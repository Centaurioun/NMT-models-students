Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day?
Do you know how many choices you make in typical week?
I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans, and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about 70 in a typical day.
There was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CEOs engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks.
And they found that the average CEO engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.
Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time.
Think about your own choices.
Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category?
How well do you think you're doing at managing those choices?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have, which is the choice overload problem.
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions.
Now as I talk about this problem, I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answers.
So when I ask you a question, since I'm blind, only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.
Otherwise, when I ask you a question, and if your answer is yes, I'd like you to clap your hands.
So for my first question for you today: Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?
Thank you.
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store; at least at that time it was truly upscale.
It was a store called Draeger's.
Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.
I used to love going to this store, but on one occasion I asked myself, well how come you never buy anything?
Here's their olive oil aisle.
They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil, including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager, and I asked the manager, "Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"
And he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday, with cameras ready usually.
We decided to do a little experiment, and we picked jam for our experiment.
Here's their jam aisle.
They had 348 different kinds of jam.
We set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store.
We there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam, and we looked at two things: First, in which case were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?
More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent, than when there were six, about 40 percent.
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam.
Now we see the opposite effect.
Of the people who stopped when there were 24, only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.
Of the people who stopped when there were six, well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.
Now if you do the math, people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24.
Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it's good for our waistlines -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions.
We choose not to choose, even when it goes against our best self-interests.
So now for the topic of today: financial savings.
Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plans all in the U.S.
And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan, the 401 plan, does that affect people's likelihood to save more for tomorrow.
And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation.
So in these plans, we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.
And what we found was that, the more funds offered, indeed, there was less participation rate.
So if you look at the extremes, those plans that offered you two funds, participation rates were around in the mid-70s -- still not as high as we want it to be.
In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds, participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile.
Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present, even then, it has negative consequences.
So for those people who did choose to participate, the more choices available, the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.
The more choices available, the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts.
Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well-being.
Well, over the past decade, we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices.
They're more likely to delay choosing -- procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.
They're more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices, medical choices.
They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied, even when they do objectively better.
The main reason for this is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams, but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display.
So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses.
The first: Cut.
You've heard it said before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, "Cut."
They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.
But in fact, what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut, get rid of those extraneous redundant options, well there's an increase in sales, there's a lowering of costs, there is an improvement of the choosing experience.
When Proctor &amp; Gamble went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15, they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.
When the Golden Cat Corporation got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products, they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs.
You know, the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products.
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest retailer, the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is Aldi, and it offers you only 1,400 products -- one kind of canned tomato sauce.
Now in the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing, which was the program that they have at Harvard.
Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund.
For those people who actually want to choose, they're given 20 funds, not 300 or more funds.
You know, often, people say, "I don't know how to cut.
They're all important choices."
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees, "Tell me how these choices are different from one another.
And if your employees can't tell them apart, neither can your consumers."
Now before we started our session this afternoon, I had a chat with Gary.
And Gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here's a description of the road.
And I'd like you to read it.
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.
Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.
Is that all?
All right, let me show you some more about this.
You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.
Now who's ready to go on this trip.
I think I might have actually heard more hands.
All right.
Now in fact, you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around, but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around.
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you.
Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem, which is concretization.
That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices, they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice, and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an ATM card or a credit card Because it doesn't feel like real money.
And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more.
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero, we did a study with people at ING -- employees that are all working at ING -- and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan.
And during that session, we kept the session exactly the way it used to be, but we added one little thing.
The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more.
By doing that simple thing, there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent.
The third technique: Categorization.
We can handle more categories than we can handle choices.
So for example, here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.
It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor, the magazine aisles range anywhere from 331 different kinds of magazines all the way up to 664.
But you know what?
If I show you 600 magazines and I divide them up into 10 categories, versus I show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories, you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600.
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.
Here are two different jewelry displays.
One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing."
If you think the display on the left is Swing and the display on the right is Jazz, clap your hands.
Okay, there's some.
If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, clap your hands.
Okay, a bit more.
Now it turns out you're right.
The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, but you know what?
This is a highly useless categorization scheme.
The categories need to say something to the chooser, not the choice-maker.
And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.
It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can, we've just got to take it a little easier.
We have to gradually increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.
Let's take a very, very complicated decision: buying a car.
Here's a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.
You've got to make 60 different decisions, completely make up your car.
Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision.
Car colors, exterior car colors -- I've got 56 choices.
Engines, gearshift -- four choices.
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.
So half of the customers are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors, to low choice, four gearshifts.
The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts, to 56 car colors, high choice.
What am I going to look at?
How engaged you are.
If you keep hitting the default button per decision, that means you're getting overwhelmed, that means I'm losing you.
What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice, they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.
We're losing them.
They go from low choice to high choice, they're hanging in there.
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.
The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented.
If I start you off easy, I learn how to choose.
Even though choosing gearshift doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor, it still prepares me for how to choose.
It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together, so I'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged.
So let me recap.
I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives; concretize -- make it real; categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices; condition for complexity.
All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you, you can use them on yourself, better for the people that you are serving.
Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing.
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing.
Thank you very much.
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations, about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago, bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today?
This is not a finished story.
It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece: a man burning his life's work.
He is a poet, a playwright, a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom.
Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon, confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste.
Words, for so long his friends, now mocked him.
He retreated into silence.
He died broken by history.
He is my grandfather.
I never knew him in real life.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never let me forget his life.
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain, and my lesson was to learn that, yes, history tried to crush us, but we endured.
The next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea.
My mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage, already with two small girls.
For her, life had distilled itself into one task: the escape of her family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed.
So after a four-year saga that defies fiction, a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was of pirates, rape and death.
Like most adults on the boat, my mother carried a small bottle of poison.
If we were captured, first my sister and I, then she and my grandmother would drink.
My first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine, the bow dipping into each wave, the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates who came many times, but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died, the journey's end too much for him, and the first apple I tasted, given to me by the men on the rig.
No apple has ever tasted the same.
After three months in a refugee camp, we landed in Melbourne.
And the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together.
We settled in Footscray, a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants.
Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs, whose existence I was oblivious of, there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray.
The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world.
And the snippets of halting English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common, they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double shifts.
Somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications.
We were poor.
All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out, which was usually new clothes; they were always secondhand.
Two pairs of stockings for school, each to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform down to the ankles, because it had to last for six years.
And there were rare but searing chants of "slit-eye" and the occasional graffiti: "Asian, go home."
Go home to where?
Something stiffened inside me.
There was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying, "I will bypass you."
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted each night, but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.
My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat.
And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her.
She opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition, and troubled children caught between two worlds.
Grants and sponsors were sought.
Centers were established.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic Asian student, relentless in the demands that I made on myself.
In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious, tragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But so many over the years were helped.
And for that work, when I was a final year law student, I was chosen as the young Australian of the year.
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another, and their edges didn't fit.
Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident, was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist, invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the cutlery.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years, telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed.
I told my mother I couldn't do it.
She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat.
No had never been an option.
"Just do it," she said, "and don't be what you're not."
So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised.
And the more candidly I spoke, the more I was asked to speak.
I met people from all walks of life, so many of them doing the thing they loved, living on the frontiers of possibility.
And even though I finished my degree, I realized I could not settle into a career in law.
There had to be another piece of the jigsaw.
And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider, new on the scene -- and not just okay, but something to be thankful for, perhaps a gift from the boat.
Because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons, can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province.
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that, yes, the world does fall apart, but not in the way that you fear.
Possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged.
There was an energy there, an implacable optimism, a strange mixture of humility and daring.
So I followed my hunches.
I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label "It can't be done" was an irresistible challenge.
For a year we were penniless.
At the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared.
We worked well into each night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but a few were brilliant, and we broke through.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip.
My hunches again.
Three months later I had relocated, and the adventure has continued.
Before I close though, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died soon after she was born.
Her mother raised her alone.
At 17 she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her.
With no support from her husband, she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case, and a far greater sensation when she won.
"It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in Melbourne.
I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side.
I knew she had come to say goodbye.
My mother phoned minutes later.
A few days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket.
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her.
At midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket.
My mother asked us to feel her hand.
She asked the monk, "Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?"
"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said.
"You have not let it go."
If there is a sinew in our family, it runs through the women.
Given who we were and how life had shaped us, we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us.
Defeat would have come too easily.
Now I would like to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could ever wish it on their own?
Yet I am afraid of privilege, of ease, of entitlement.
Can I give them a bow in their lives, dipping bravely into each wave, the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine, the vast horizon that guarantees nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and still see them safely through, Trevor Neilson: And also, Tan's mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row.
Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters.
We all want to be stars -- celebrities, singers, comedians -- and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do in a part of our world's culture.
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday.
But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube And of that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.
So how does it happen?
Three things: tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness.
All right, let's go.
Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wooo!
Ohhhhh, wowwww!
KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.
This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer.
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.
He just wanted to share a rainbow.
Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.
And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.
And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January.
So what happened here?
Jimmy Kimmel actually.
Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience.
Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. ♫ ♫ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. ♫ ♫ Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday. ♫ KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope.
Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.
It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.
This is a chart of what it looked like.
And similar to "Double Rainbow," it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.
So what happened on this day?
Well it was a Friday, this is true.
And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.
But what about this day, this one particular Friday?
Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.
Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it.
And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.
Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week.
Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century, is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.
So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation with looped music.
It's this, just like this.
It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.
And if you think that that is weird, you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that's been viewed four million times.
Even cats were watching this video.
Cats were watching other cats watch this video.
But what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.
There were remixes.
Someone made an old timey version.
And then it went international.
An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of.
Because we don't just enjoy now, And who could have predicted any of this?
Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it?
In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have.
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested.
Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane, but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane.
KA: By being totally surprising and humorous, Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively.
And so it all brings us to one big question ...
Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?
Ohhhh.
KA: What does it mean?
Tastemakers, creative participating communities, complete unexpectedness, these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture and the audience defines the popularity.
one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber, No one has to green-light your idea.
And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture.
And these are not characteristics of old media, and they're barely true of the media of today, but they will define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
I'm here to share my photography.
Or is it photography?
Because, of course, this is a photograph that you can't take with your camera.
Yet, my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15.
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing, but it was a bit different, the process was in the planning instead.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends when you press the trigger.
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time.
I felt like anyone could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, something where the process starts when you press the trigger.
Photos like this: construction going on along a busy road.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And despite that, it retains a level of realism.
Or photos like these -- both dark and colorful, but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism.
When I say realism, I mean photo-realism.
Because, of course, it's not something you can capture really, but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick.
So it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really.
But what's the trick that makes it look realistic?
Is it something about the details or the colors?
Is it something about the light?
What creates the illusion?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really what is realistic, it's what we think looks realistic really.
So I think the basics are quite simple.
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together And let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects, something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, they can create something that still looks three-dimensional, But at the same time, we know it can't.
So we trick our brains, because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process with combining photographs.
It's just really about combining different realities.
So the things that make a photograph look realistic, I think it's the things that we don't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives.
But when combining photographs, this is really important to consider, because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result.
As you can see, these images aren't really special.
But combined, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective.
Secondly, photos combined should have the same type of light.
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light.
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed.
So by matching color, contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images, adding photographic defects like depth of field, desaturated colors and noise, we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image, despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically.
So here's another example.
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipulated.
But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations.
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place, because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head.
But it does require a lot of planning.
And getting this idea during winter, I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically.
So for example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.
And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish.
So to achieve a realistic result, I think it comes down to planning.
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.
Then it's about combining the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well planned.
And if you do a good job capturing the photos, the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic.
So all the tools are out there, and the only thing that limits us Thank you.
I would like to talk to you about why many e-health projects fail.
And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at Radboud University is we appointed a chief listening officer.
Not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients, family, relatives, "What's up?
How could we help you?"
And we think, we like to think, that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-health projects fail, since we stopped listening.
This is my WiFi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It's got one knob, on/off.
And every morning I hop on it.
And yes, I've got a challenge, as you might see.
And I put my challenge on 95 kg.
But the thing is that it's made this simple that whenever I hop on, it sends my data through Google Health as well.
And it's collected by my general practitioner as well, so he can see what's my problem in weight, not on the very moment that I need cardiologic support or something like it, but also looking backward.
But there's another thing.
As some of you might know, I've got more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I hop on my WiFi scale and before I'm in my car, people start talking to me, "I think you need a light lunch today, Lucien."
But that's the nicest thing that could happen, since this is peer pressure, peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity, it could be used to stop smoking in patients.
But on the other hand, it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health.
As of next week, it will soon be available.
There will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other.
And people will be able, from their homes, to take their blood pressure, send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others, for instance, for over a hundred dollars.
And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect, not only their own control again, be captain of their own ship, but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face, like health care cost explosion, doubled demand and things like that.
Make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team.
And you can do this with techniques like this, but also by crowd-sourcing.
And one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video.
We've all got navigation controls in our car.
We maybe even [have] it in our cellphone.
We know perfectly where all the ATMs are about the city of Maastricht.
The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are.
And sure, we could find fast food chains.
But where would be the nearest AED to help this patient?
We asked around and nobody knew.
Nobody knew where the nearest life-saving AED was to be obtained right now.
So what we did, we crowdsourced The Netherlands.
We set up a website and asked the crowd, "If you see an AED, please submit it, tell us where it is, tell us when it's open," since sometimes in office hours sometimes it's closed, of course.
And over 10,000 AEDs already in The Netherlands already have been submitted.
The next step we took was to find the applications for it.
And we built an iPad application.
We made an application for Layar, augmented reality, to find these AEDs.
And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collapses, you can use your iPhone, and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone, to find the nearest AED which can save lives.
And as of today, we would like to introduce this, not only as AED4EU, which is what the product is called, but also AED4US.
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level.
And [we're] asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world, colleague universities, to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowd-source all these AEDs all around the world.
That whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses, might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you, you can find this.
The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these AEDs.
These might be courier services or cable guys for instance, just to see whether the AED that's submitted still is in place.
So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better, but take control of it.
Thank you.
So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate; we have them work in government.
The program is called Code for America, and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.
We select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments.
Instead of sending them off into the Third World, we send them into the wilds of City Hall.
And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.
But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible So meet Al.
Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date, but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in, because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires when he's covered in four feet of snow.
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner?
We had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program.
They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.
And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants.
But one fellow in particular, a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober, noticed something else, and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things.
So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app.
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.
If you do, you get to name it, and he called the first one Al.
And if you don't, someone can steal it from you.
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.
This is a modest little app.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.
But it's doing something that no other government technology does.
It's spreading virally.
There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it, not for snow, but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.
It's very important that these tsunami sirens work, but people steal the batteries out of them.
So he's getting citizens to check on them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.
And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this.
And this has spread just frictionlessly, If you know anything about government technology, you know that this isn't how it normally goes.
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years.
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months.
It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids.
We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels, it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally, that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government.
It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company, as many people think it should.
And not even like a tech company, but more like the Internet itself.
And that means permissionless, it means open, it means generative.
And that's important.
But what's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an ossified institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's great news, because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action Now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively.
It's not just Code for America fellows, there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up on government.
They are frustrated as hell with it, but they're not complaining about it, they're fixing it.
And these folks know something that we've lost sight of.
And that's that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DMV and all those other things that we're really mad about, government is, at its core, in the words of Tim O'Reilly, "What we do together that we can't do alone."
Now a lot of people have given up on government.
And if you're one of those people, I would ask that you reconsider, because things are changing.
Politics is not changing; government is changing.
And because government ultimately derives its power from us -- remember "We the people?" -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens.
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.
And like a lot of people, I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.
Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion that, especially local government, is about opossums.
This is the call center for the services and information line.
It's generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city.
If you should ever have the chance to staff your city's call center, as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program -- in fact, they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues, including having an opossum stuck in your house.
So Scott gets this call.
He types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base.
He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control.
And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves?"
So that worked. So booya for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the opossums.
Boston doesn't just have a call center.
It has an app, a Web and mobile app, called Citizens Connect.
Now we didn't write this app.
This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in: "Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead.
How do I get this removed?"
But what happens with Citizens Connect is different.
So Scott was speaking person-to-person.
But on Citizens Connect everything is public, so everybody can see this.
And in this case, a neighbor saw it.
And the next report we got said, "I walked over to this location, found the trashcan behind the house.
Opossum? Check. Living? Yep.
Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home.
Goodnight sweet opossum."
Pretty simple.
So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical.
And it's also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here.
I'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others.
So one citizen helped another citizen, but government played a key role here.
It connected those two people.
And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed, but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services.
When one neighbor helps another, we strengthen our communities.
We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.
Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics.
And most people get that, but they think that one is the input to the other.
That our input to the system of government Now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs, and then not that much changes?
That's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top.
And what's under that is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with such contempt.
But it's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that's working against us, this other thing, and then we're disempowering ourselves.
People seem to think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work for us, we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government happens.
We have to engage with the machinery of government.
So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.
Have you seen these guys?
It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 325-page report that's a response to the SEC's request for comment on the Financial Reform Bill.
That's not being politically active, that's being bureaucratically active.
Now for those of us who've given up on government, it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face.
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us?
We can't do without government, but we do need it to be more effective.
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society.
And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet, and they know that it's not that hard to do things together, you just have to architect the systems the right way.
Now the average age of our fellows is 28, so I am, begrudgingly, almost a generation older than most of them.
This is a generation that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak; they all get to speak.
They can express their opinion on any channel at any time, and they do.
So when they're faced with the problem of government, they don't care as much about using their voices.
They're using their hands.
They're using their hands to write applications that make government work better.
And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better.
That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed, turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.
And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along, and many people do.
But these apps are like little digital reminders that we're not just consumers, and we're not just consumers of government, putting in our taxes and getting back services.
We're more than that, we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship.
So the question I have for all of you here: When it comes to the big, important things that we need to do together, all of us together, are we just going to be a crowd of voices, or are we also going to be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
Now I work in the solar technology industry.
And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing.
It's just a quick video of what we do.
Huh. Hang on a moment.
It might take a moment to load.
We'll just -- we can just skip -- I'll just skip through the video instead ...
No.
This is not ...
Okay.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, that's all my time?
Okay. Thank you very much.
My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the starry skies with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.
And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata."
So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky.
Now we do the same with airplanes.
when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince, when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow, he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.
Now we do the same with drills and machines.
The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced And this made me really sad.
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.
without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.
And it felt like technology should enable magic, not kill it.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.
And this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me.
It became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination.
So I felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming.
They stopped us from being inspired.
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology, to see how I could use it to enable magic I've been illustrating books since I was 16.
And so when I saw the iPad, I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world.
It can know how we're holding it.
It can know where we are.
It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch.
Storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial.
But what are we doing with it?
So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya, an interactive app for the iPad.
So it says, "Place your fingers upon each light."
And so -- It says, "This box belongs to ... " And so I type in my name.
And actually I become a character in the book.
At various points, a little letter drops down to me -- and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS -- The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities.
Now I've been talking a lot about magic.
And I don't mean wizards and dragons, I mean the kind of childhood magic, those ideas that we all harbored as children.
This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason, was always really exciting to me.
And so over here you need to tilt your iPad, And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book.
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained to this magical device within the device.
And it opens up a map.
All along, all fantasy books have always had maps, but these maps have been static.
This is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.
It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.
So I'm just going to enter in.
Another thing that's actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary.
Over here, these are the Apsaras.
So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs, but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?
These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book.
And so we're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children.
And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis.
I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms, glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out.
we can actually take our children outside into the natural world One of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on this quest take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different natural objects.
When I was a child, I had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.
And somehow kids don't do that anymore.
So in bringing back this childhood ritual, you need to go out and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that.
And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online.
A child in London puts up a picture of a fox and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today."
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today."
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you've actually taken.
In the possibilities of linking together magic, the earth and technology, there are multiple possibilities.
In the next book, we plan on having an interaction where you take your iPad out with the video on appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.
At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.
And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book.
We're moving, we're all moving here, to a world where the forces of nature and magic and technology can come closer together.
We're harnessing energy from the sun.
We're bringing our children and ourselves and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story.
Thank you.

Peter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips I collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years.
The point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that's what our minds pay attention to.
And there's a very good reason for that.
Every second of every day, our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains.
And because nothing is more important to us than survival, the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala.
Now the amygdala is our early warning detector, our danger detector.
It sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us.
So given a dozen news stories, we will preferentially look at the negative news.
And that old newspaper saying, "If it bleeds it leads," is very true.
So given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder that we're pessimistic.
It's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse.
But perhaps that's not the case.
Perhaps instead, it's the distortions brought to us of what's really going on.
Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of forces are, in fact, accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance.
Now I'm not saying we don't have our set of problems -- climate crisis, species extinction, water and energy shortage -- we surely do.
And as humans, we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance, but ultimately we knock them down.
So let's look at what this last century has been to see where we're going.
Over the last hundred years, the average human lifespan has more than doubled, average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled.
Childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10.
Add to that the cost of food, electricity, transportation, communication have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold.
Steve Pinker has showed us that, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history.
And Charles Kenny that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We truly are living in an extraordinary time.
And many people forget this.
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher.
In fact, we redefine what poverty means.
Think of this, in America today, the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, television, mobile phones, air conditioning and cars.
The wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet, could have never dreamed of such luxuries.
Underpinning much of this is technology, and of late, exponentially growing technologies.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law, and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months.
That's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to notice two things from this curve.
Number one, how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time, war time and peace time, recession, depression and boom time.
This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers.
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.
And also, even though it's plotted on a log curve on the left, it's curving upwards.
The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster.
And on this curve, riding on Moore's Law, are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us.
Cloud computing, what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing; sensors and networks; robotics; 3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet; synthetic biology; fuels, vaccines and foods; digital medicine; nanomaterials; and A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy by IBM's Watson?
I mean, that was epic.
In fact, I scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could.
And I love this: "Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents."
Jeopardy's not an easy game.
It's about the nuance of human language.
And imagine if you would A.I.'s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone.
Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Singularity University.
And we teach our students all of these technologies, and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity's grand challenges.
And every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade.
Think about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today.
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous.
Today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that.
When I think about creating abundance, it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet; it's about creating a life of possibility.
It is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant.
You see, scarcity is contextual, and technology is a resource-liberating force.
Let me give you an example.
So this is a story of Napoleon III in the mid-1800s.
He's the dude on the left.
He invited over to dinner the king of Siam.
All of Napoleon's troops were fed with silver utensils, Napoleon himself with gold utensils.
But the King of Siam, he was fed with aluminum utensils.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, worth more than gold and platinum.
It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass, it doesn't come as a pure metal.
It's all bound by oxygen and silicates.
But then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw-away mentality.
So let's project this analogy going forward.
We think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface every 88 minutes.
It's not about being scarce, it's about accessibility.
And there's good news here.
For the first time, this year the cost of solar-generated electricity is 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India -- 8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average.
And if we have abundant energy, we also have abundant water.
Now we talk about water wars.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth, in 1990 after it just passed Saturn?
He took a famous photo. What was it called?
"A Pale Blue Dot."
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water.
Yes, 97.5 percent is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet, but here too there is hope.
And there is technology coming online, not 10, 20 years from now, right now.
There's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials.
And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the great DIY innovators, I'd like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of, it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source -- saltwater, polluted water, latrine -- at less than two cents a liter.
The chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world.
And if that pans out, which I have every confidence it will, Coca-Cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet.
This is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology, that exists today.
And we've seen this in cellphones.
My goodness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of 2013.
Think about it, that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile comm than President Reagan did 25 years ago.
And if they're on a smartphone on Google, they've got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago.
They're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted.
Better than that, the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- GPS, HD video and still images, libraries of books and music, medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone.
Probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pike in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation something called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.
We're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to, because it's got A.I., you can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick.
And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board-certified doctors.
So literally, imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers.
When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn't recognize, it calls the CDC and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place.
But here, here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance.
I call it the rising billion.
So the white lines here are population.
We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth.
And by the way, the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy.
In 2010, we had just short of two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, that's going from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation.
What will these people want?
What will they consume? What will they desire?
And rather than having economic shutdown, we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy.
And they will get healthier by using the Tricorder, and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy, and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infinite computing [become] more productive than ever before.
So what could three billion rising, healthy, educated, productive members of humanity bring to us?
How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before.
What about giving the oppressed, wherever they might be, the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever?
What will these three billion people bring?
What about contributions we can't even predict?
The one thing I've learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things, things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past.
Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited.
There is a program that some of you might have heard of.
It's a game called Foldit.
It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle.
And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold.
And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality.
And it's very important for research in medicine.
And up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem.
And this game has been played by university professors and so forth.
And it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it.
And it showed that, in fact, today, the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers.
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world, it wasn't an MIT professor, it wasn't a CalTech student, it was a person from England, from Manchester, a woman who, during the day, was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and, at night, was the world's best protein folder.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the DIY innovator.
We have the capital of the techno-philanthropist.
And we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges, to do that which we must do.
We are living into extraordinary decades ahead.
Thank you.
I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change.
And I think it starts with one physician, and that's me.
And maybe I've been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that.
Before I actually begin the meat of my talk, let's begin with a bit of baseball.
Hey, why not?
We're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series.
We all love baseball, don't we?
Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics.
And there's hundreds of them.
"Moneyball" is about to come out, and it's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one stat that I hope a lot of you have heard of.
It's called batting average.
So we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300.
That means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely three times out of 10 at bats.
That means hit the ball into the outfield, it dropped, it didn't get caught, and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time and the runner was safe.
Three times out of 10.
Do you know what they call a 300 hitter in Major League Baseball?
Good, really good, maybe an all-star.
Do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter?
That's somebody who hit, by the way, four times safely out of every 10.
Legendary -- as in Ted Williams legendary -- the last Major League Baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season.
Now let's take this back into my world of medicine where I'm a lot more comfortable, or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I'm going to talk to you about.
Suppose you have appendicitis and you're referred to a surgeon who's batting 400 on appendectomies.
Somehow this isn't working out, is it?
Now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who's batting 200 on angioplasties.
But, but, you know what?
She's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail.
And she's hitting a 257.
Somehow this isn't working.
But I'm going to ask you a question.
What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon, an OBGYN, a paramedic is supposed to be?
1,000, very good.
Now truth of the matter is, nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat.
What we do though is we send each one of them, including myself, out into the world with the admonition, be perfect.
Never ever, ever make a mistake, but you worry about the details, about how that's going to happen.
And that was the message that I absorbed when I was in med school.
I was an obsessive compulsive student.
In high school, a classmate once said that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test.
And so I did.
And I studied in my little garret at the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital, not far from here.
And I memorized everything.
I memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle, every branch of every artery that came off the aorta, differential diagnoses obscure and common.
I even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis.
And all the while, I was amassing more and more knowledge.
And I did well, I graduated with honors, cum laude.
And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything, or as much as possible, as close to everything as possible, that it would immunize me against making mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. Drucker.
I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation.
And it was my job, when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult, to see that patient in emerg.
and to report back to my attending.
And I saw Mrs. Drucker, and she was breathless.
And when I listened to her, she was making a wheezy sound.
And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope, I could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure.
This is a condition in which the heart fails, and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward, some of the blood backs up into the lung, the lungs fill up with blood, and that's why you have shortness of breath.
And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make.
I made it and I set to work treating her.
I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart.
I gave her medications that we call diuretics, water pills, to get her to pee out the access fluid.
And over the course of the next hour and a half or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt really good.
And that's when I made my first mistake; I sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
I sent her home without speaking to my attending.
I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do, which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself.
And he knew her, he would have been able to furnish additional information about her.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients without even having to contact him.
The second mistake that I made was worse.
In sending her home, I disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me, "Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this."
In fact, so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker, "Do you think it's okay if she goes home?"
And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly, "Yeah, I think she'll do okay."
I can remember that like it was yesterday.
So I signed the discharge papers, and an ambulance came, paramedics came to take her home.
And I went back to my work on the wards.
All the rest of that day, that afternoon, I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach.
But I carried on with my work.
And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don't usually do.
I walked through the emergency department on my way home.
And it was there that another nurse, not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse, said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread.
Others in medicine dread them as well, but there's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly.
The three words are: Do you remember?
"Do you remember that patient you sent home?"
the other nurse asked matter-of-factly.
"Well she's back," in just that tone of voice.
Well she was back all right.
She was back and near death.
About an hour after she had arrived home, after I'd sent her home, she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50, which is in severe shock.
And she was barely breathing and she was blue.
And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops.
They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure.
They put her on a ventilator.
And I was shocked and shaken to the core.
And I went through this roller coaster, because after they stabilized her, she went to the intensive care unit, and I hoped against hope that she would recover.
And over the next two or three days, it was clear that she was never going to wake up.
She had irreversible brain damage.
And the family gathered.
And over the course of the next eight or nine days, they resigned themselves to what was happening.
And at about the nine day mark, they let her go -- Mrs. Drucker, a wife, a mother and a grandmother.
They say you never forget the names of those who die.
And that was my first time to be acquainted with that.
Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel, because you can't talk about it with your colleagues.
You know that healthy kind, when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions, but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say, I'll never make that mistake again.
And you make amends and you never make that mistake again.
That's the kind of shame that is a teacher.
The unhealthy shame I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside.
It's the one that says, not that what you did was bad, but that you are bad.
And it was what I was feeling.
And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll.
He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued.
And I kept asking myself these questions.
Why didn't I ask my attending? Why did I send her home?
And then at my worst moments: Why did I make such a stupid mistake?
Why did I go into medicine?
Slowly but surely, it lifted.
I began to feel a bit better.
And on a cloudy day, there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered, maybe I could feel better again.
And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop.
And they did.
And I went back to work.
And then it happened again.
Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto, and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat.
It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.
He kept pointing here.
I looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink.
And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way.
And even as he was walking out the door, he was still sort of pointing to his throat.
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
And she said the three words: Do you remember?
"Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?"
Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat.
He had a potentially life-threatening condition called epiglottitis.
You can Google it, but it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway, and it can actually cause the airway to close.
And fortunately he didn't die.
He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Twice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis.
Now that takes some doing, especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night.
Now in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think there was any gap in their care.
One I thought had a kidney stone.
I ordered a kidney X-ray. When it turned out to be normal, my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons.
The other one had a lot of diarrhea.
I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him.
And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons.
In both cases, they had their operations and they did okay.
But each time, they were gnawing at me, eating at me.
And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S.
Some of my doozies have been in the last five years.
Alone, ashamed and unsupported.
Here's the problem: If I can't come clean and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the still-small voice that tells me what really happened, how can I share it with my colleagues?
How can I teach them about what I did so that they don't do the same thing?
If I were to walk into a room -- like right now, I have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure?
Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor, but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I've just told you right now, I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable, somebody would crack a joke, they'd change the subject and we would move on.
And in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital, believe me, I'd have trouble making eye contact with that person.
That's the system that we have.
It's a complete denial of mistakes.
It's a system in which there are two kinds of positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don't, those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can, those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, like the antibodies begin to attack that person.
And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine, what will we be left with, but a safe system.
But there are two problems with that.
In my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism, I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can, from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show "White Coat, Black Art."
And what I've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.
We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage, where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous, causing havoc and death.
In this country, as many as 24,000 Canadians die of preventable medical errors.
In the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000.
In both cases, these are gross underestimates, because we really aren't ferreting out the problem as we should.
And here's the thing.
In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years, we can't keep up with it.
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.
We can't get rid of it.
We have our cognitive biases, so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain.
Now take the same patient with chest pain, make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath, and suddenly my history is laced with contempt.
I don't take the same history.
I'm not a robot; I don't do things the same way each time.
And my patients aren't cars; they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time.
Given all of that, mistakes are inevitable.
So if you take the system, as I was taught, and weed out all the error-prone health professionals, well there won't be anybody left.
And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases?
On my show, on "White Coat, Black Art," I made it a habit of saying, "Here's my worst mistake," I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery, "Here's my worst mistake," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, "What about yours?" and I would point the microphone towards them.
And their pupils would dilate, they would recoil, then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories.
They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories.
They want to be able to say, "Look, don't make the same mistake I did."
What they need is an environment to be able to do that.
What they need is a redefined medical culture.
And it starts with one physician at a time.
The redefined physician is human, knows she's human, accepts it, isn't proud of making mistakes, but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else.
She shares her experience with others.
She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes.
And she points out other people's mistakes, not in a gotcha way, but in a loving, supportive way so that everybody can benefit.
And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system, and when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time.
So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving, supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mistakes, we're rewarded for coming clean.
My name is Brian Goldman.
I am a redefined physician.
I'm human. I make mistakes.
I'm sorry about that, but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people.
I still don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me close with three words of my own: I do remember.
In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany, if you owned a typewriter, you had to register it with the government.
You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter.
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from.
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought, they could track down who created that thought.
And we in the West couldn't understand how anybody could do this, how much this would restrict freedom of speech.
We would never do that in our own countries.
But today in 2011, if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer.
This is happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it.
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us, the citizens.
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today.
If we take a look at what's really happening in the online world, we can group the attacks based on the attackers.
We have three main groups.
We have online criminals.
Like here, we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine.
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use online attacks to make lots of money, and lots and lots of it.
We actually have several cases of millionaires online, multimillionaires, who made money with their attacks.
Here's Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia.
This is Alfred Gonzalez.
This is Stephen Watt.
This is Bjorn Sundin.
This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on.
These guys make their fortunes online, but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking, or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer.
The U.S. Secret Service, two months ago, froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here, and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen.
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose; nobody knows where he is.
And I claim it's already today that it's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world.
And it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse.
In the future, the majority of crime will be happening online.
The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money.
They're motivated by something else -- motivated by protests, motivated by an opinion, motivated by the laughs.
Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks.
So those are the three main attackers: criminals who do it for the money, hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest, but then the last group are nation states, governments doing the attacks.
And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar.
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens.
DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands -- or actually, it was.
It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into.
Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly.
And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives, I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack.
And his answer was yes.
So how do people die as the result of a hack like this?
Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
They sell certificates.
What do you do with certificates?
Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https, SSL encrypted services, services like Gmail.
Now we all, or a big part of us, use Gmail or one of their competitors, but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran, where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections, so the local government can't snoop on their discussions.
Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
and issue rogue certificates.
And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar.
What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening, for example, in Egypt?
Well in Egypt, the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers.
Among those papers, was this binder entitled "FINFISHER."
And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government.
The company headquarters are right here.
So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens.
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found, which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are a suspect in a criminal case, well it's pretty obvious, your phone will be tapped.
But today, it goes beyond that.
They will tap your Internet connection.
They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan, which enables them to watch all your communication, to listen to your online discussions, to collect your passwords.
Now when we think deeper about things like these, the obvious response from people should be that, "Okay, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen.
Why should I worry?
Because I have nothing to hide."
And this is an argument, which doesn't make sense.
Privacy is implied.
Privacy is not up for discussion.
This is not a question between privacy against security.
It's a question of freedom against control.
And while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011, any right we give away will be given away for good.
And do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government, a government we might have 50 years from now?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years.
This may sound strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea: modules made of cement of a fixed measurement Very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world.
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us, buildings, bridges, one brick at a time.
Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time.
Almost a hundred years later in 1947, LEGO came up with this.
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.
And in a few short years, LEGO bricks took place in every household.
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.
LEGO made it accessible.
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world, and made it into the building block of our imagination.
Meanwhile the exact same year, at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced, the next building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to build much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.
But there's a main difference: The transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't accept this, that the building block of our time is reserved for experts, so I decided to change that.
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started developing littleBits.
Let me show you how they work.
LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function.
They're pre-engineered to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets.
So you can't put them the wrong way.
The bricks are color-coded.
Green is output, blue is power, pink is input and orange is wire.
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.
You put a blue to a green, you can make light.
You can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer.
Switch out the knob for a pulse module, which is here, and now you've made a little blinker.
Add this buzzer for some extra punch and you've created a noise machine.
I'm going to stop that.
So beyond simple play, littleBits are actually pretty powerful.
Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder, littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
So to make this blink faster or slower, you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind littleBits is that it's a growing library.
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick.
Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors -- everything should be accessible.
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools.
For example, how a nightlight works, or why an elevator door stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.
So for example, we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material.
Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles, we have Geordie making ...
A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something."
Here's an example of a project they made, a motion-activated confetti canon ball.
But wait, this is actually my favorite project.
It's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark.
To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material, electronics became just another material.
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.
So littleBits is open-source.
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.
We want to encourage a world of creators, of inventors, of contributors, because this world that we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So go ahead and start inventing.
Thank you.
