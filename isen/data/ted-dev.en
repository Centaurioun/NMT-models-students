Let's see the next video, please.
If you want coffee, you have to pay for it yourself, it's two euros 50.
And here's how it went.
Then you have the clapping audience, yeah, actually taking part in doing the music.
The symptoms were real, he said, but they had no biological cause.
He means Mozart, which is — (Laughter) — like a third seat from the center.
One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie, told me that I did not take her pain into consideration.
In the US, we spend each year roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient, 250 dollars per MS patient and just 5 dollars per year per ME patient.
And nobody thought about criminalizing it back then because nobody wanted to put Grandma behind bars.
Then he practices for another year and takes lessons — now he's 10.
That's it.
If the eyes are not shining, you get to ask a question.
Half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind.
(Claps) Itay Talgam: Good.
One of them is winning the lottery.
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital, you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.
So control is no longer a zero-sum game.
Of course we can.
Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.
Now during this time, the book was the king of storytelling.
But automation in cars allowed that to separate, so driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak, from engineering of the car or learning how to service it.
But if I do this with amnesiac patients, they don't have a clue.
And from that point on I started thinking, are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision, or is it a more general case?
And what happens?
All of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India.
Supermarkets as well.
Let's see.
This is a global problem.
And it's so tempting to think that it's all about me.
I mean, don't forget, we're the ones who thought that we could prohibit alcohol.
So, supermarkets.
But since today is Tuesday, let me just say that legally regulating and taxing most of the drugs that are now criminalized would radically reduce the crime, violence, corruption and black markets, and the problems of adulterated and unregulated drugs, and improve public safety, and allow taxpayer resources to be developed to more useful purposes.
We have this view of ourselves, of others.
Even between neighbors.
It doesn't work.
That somehow, if you use a computer, it's all mindless button-pushing, but if you do it by hand, it's all intellectual.
It was about the norms for cheating.
The benefits of doing so are enormous, the risks minimal.
And then they look at each other.
Huntington, where I made this program, we've got this prime-time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change.
And I say, "OK, this looks nice, let me print it out, that thing."
All I had were my symptoms, which I could describe, but no one else can see.
Now, what I want to show you is that people don't know this about themselves, and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage.
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.
(Music) For this delight and for this wonder, people rejoiced.
Most of you might be aware that, in those days, the mouse used to come with a ball inside, and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving, and, accordingly, where the mouse is moving.
This is about 314 million dollars.
In the late 19th century, when most of the drugs that are now illegal were legal, the principal consumers of opiates in my country and others were middle-aged white women, using them to alleviate aches and pains when few other analgesics were available.
What is the general point?
When we remind people about their morality, they cheat less.
And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting, but also it tells us something, I think, about the stock market situation we're in.
Was that nice?
I talked my way into the State Department.
So you could say that school food is quite important, really, judging the circumstances.
You go out on a date with a guy, and he picks his nose; you don't go out on another date.
I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people.
The second point, or course, is that if somebody invites you to bar hop, you know what they think about you.
Potato?
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities, and I want to talk to you about cheating.
It was venerable.
My wish is for you to help a strong, sustainable movement to educate every child about food, to inspire families to cook again, and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity.
Then contributors from all over the world began showing up, prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits.
There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.
Once you've done that, then there's the computation step.
Forty-five percent of patients who are eventually diagnosed with a recognized autoimmune disease are initially told they're hypochondriacs.
It's called programming.
But not in a way that you want to stop.
And I tested them.
I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz, one of the rare survivors.
Why has this idea had such staying power?
And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates.
And I came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of Coke — how long does it last in the refrigerators?
No, what I'm suggesting is that we should leap off, we should increase our velocity so it's high, and we should leap off one side and go the other — of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully.
All backwards.
How many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow, and you went to the DMV, and you encountered one of these forms, that it would actually change your own behavior?
So that was a sort of a success.
And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world.
What also gives me hope is the resilience of patients.
If the kids don't know what stuff is, then they will never eat it.
Well, it turns out when brains triple in size, they don't just get three times bigger; they gain new structures.
We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call "natural happiness."
Those learning it think it's disconnected, uninteresting and hard.
Thank you.
But this time it wasn't fine.
How do you find out?
Why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little?
People now solved seven questions on average.
We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own, which one they chose last time, which one is theirs.
This is the cover.
Now, here's the experiment we did, and I hope this is going to convince you that "Yeah, right!"
That's why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet — Ophelia going mad, the play within the play, and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.
It's difficult and it's complex.
Do you know what I think probably happened here?
I was going to talk a little bit about research, a little bit about the kitchen.
The same thing happens.
(Audio) Most modern wind turbines consist of a large...
So this shows... (Laughter) (Applause) When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery.
Here it is, finally to be revealed.
They want to know the answer, and this category allows doctors to treat what would otherwise be untreatable, to explain illnesses that have no explanation.
Gravitation is no more.
(Laughter) So that's a sort of a tradition.
And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up.
And a month later, TED phoned me up and gave me this award.
So there's another thing that comes up with basics.
You can of course watch movies.
You know why?
Sometimes I would find that I couldn't draw the right side of a circle.
It's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein.
He says, "I'm responsible."
You have to invest in health.
Can you see there?
There's your month.
Did you see the eyes?
I put fertility rate here: number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman.
That's absolutely the right thing, for people to follow their self-interest.
We've learned that a lot of people can cheat.
And I felt the tears streaming down my face.
Kleiber not only creates a process, but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place.
One is I want to remind you of what a seven-year-old child sounds like when he plays the piano.
What other way would there be to be better off?
I think that's why this is called a head-mounted projector, isn't it?
(Audience) Yeah!
Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.
And I started in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health.
Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate, but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts, however hard the calculating.
After the fever broke, for three weeks I was so dizzy, I couldn't leave my house.
And, of course, if you don't have any surface, you can start using your palm for simple operations.
So we thought Gapminder was appropriate.
Human beings have something that we might think of as a "psychological immune system."
Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math, but what I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future.
Now, you might say, "These are decisions we don't care about."
Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer?
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip, and they would grab hold and they would rip.
Bad simulators.
I had to hug the walls just to make it to the bathroom.
They don't deserve it.
(Laughter) Did you see Lenny's face?
It turns out the pre-frontal cortex does lots of things, but one of the most important things it does is an experience simulator.
Huntington, West Virginia.
What was he thinking about?
This meant that men could now get hysteria, but of course women were still the most susceptible.
No.
And finally, depending on your particular version of European similarity, you can think about the U.K. and France as either similar culturally or not, but it turns out that with organ donation, they are very different.
So you have to give me one.
I was not just unlucky.
We have very good data since 1962 — 1960 about — on the size of families in all countries.
This is the world distribution of income of people.
It's because we care.
So, the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself.
It's been four years, and I've still never been as well as I was the minute before I walked home from my neurologist's office.
And one of them said, "Because we were listening."
It's an "Mmmm..." Yeah, it comes from here.
Thank you so much.
I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders.
So you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want, and you have perfect harmony.
I worked in the schools.
So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages.
I don't think it's warranted.
How can you say something is low-fat when it's full of so much sugar?
That was a powerful talk.
But there is a silver lining.
(Applause continues)
It's called "Our Choice" and the author is Al Gore.
So what are they doing?
First of all, I enjoyed writing.
Interestingly, what I did with these rollers is, basically, I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line.
This is Africa.
And men may even have a more difficult time getting diagnosed.
What color is the top arrow pointing to?
Our good old friend.
They're not just saying it because they own it, because they don't know they own it.
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.
How would you walk?
A beloved grandmother, a lover — somebody in your life who you love with all your heart, but that person is no longer with you.
He's just about to reach the E, and he says, "Oops, better go back up and do it again."
Stacy, the Edwards family.
Now, you don't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness, I suspect.
It's impossible.
The first cocaine prohibition laws, similarly prompted by racist fears of black men sniffing that white powder and forgetting their proper place in Southern society.
So let's ask another question.
If we don't look in the data, I think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economical change.
It's very simple.
Nine years later, 12 of them were dead and 30 had become disabled.
I learned of one woman with scleroderma, an autoimmune connective tissue disease, who was told for years that it was all in her head.
You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases, people would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case.
Once like a Muti, and you'll — (Claps) — clap, just once.
Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane — improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes, and do away with all traffic jams on highways?
In other words: yes, some things are better than others.
Do not interfere.
The majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go for a hip replacement.
It's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading to realize whatever he's dreaming.
He was 78 years old.
I profoundly believe that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life.
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D.
Absolutely.
Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday.
"Tell us how much you like them now."
And that's a quite clever guy, huh?
Mountain roads, day and night, and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco.
And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescents, have to go through two adolescences.
Let's go back to the first conductor we've seen: Carlos Kleiber, his name.
And then there's a very small group.
There's a huge difference between Africa.
What happens when you do other things, like you remove things from money?
Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem, actually make it more conceptual.
I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive.
The family's obese.
Composers know that.
We've driven 140,000 miles.
Come on, with me.
You know, this little office of the conductor.
Yet, that's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice.
And I think there are some cases.
This can do 5,000 people a year, which is 10 percent of their population, and it's people on people.
And this isn't mine.
England and America, England and America.
The statistics of bad health are clear, very clear.
I can show you Africa.
Now, it's also very hard to intuit these results.
The argument is in those cases, it might be that we actually make many more mistakes.
How would you be?
It was ubiquitous.
In 1934, 198 doctors, nurses and staff at the Los Angeles County General Hospital became seriously ill.
MIT?
Or is this research forever, or what?
And then finally...
They cheat just by a little bit.
Would you be my orchestra for a second?
And that's what makes them into partners.
Imagine I give you a choice: Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome, all expenses paid — hotel, transportation, food, a continental breakfast, everything — or a weekend in Paris?
No more baton.
So over time, time and space have compressed because of this.
But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960.
That spring I got infection after infection, and every time I went to the doctor, he said there was absolutely nothing wrong.
Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen?
Lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world, except if you're learning it.
This was an example I built for my daughter.
And my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital.
And he thought, "That's a really neat idea!"
Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.
It's not about wealth and fame and power.
Mike, thanks so much.
Now, he tries the E again.
When ugly Jerry was around, Jerry was popular.
But we are not only tracking one finger, here.
But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing.
I'll give you one more example.
There is one more decision.
So the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down, but that we have dumbed-down problems right now.
Particularly, a part called the "pre-frontal cortex."
That's what Colorado and Washington are doing, and Uruguay, and others are sure to follow.
In contrast, I took a plate with six one-dollar bills, and I left those plates in the same refrigerators.
I think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that.
And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones, I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.
Now, that hypocrisy kept bugging me, so I wrote my Ph.D dissertation on international drug control.
He brought health to China.
And I said, "I want to do that."
And this is the question: who am I being that my players' eyes are not shining?
So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say, "I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."
So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed, you have to learn to do that for your digital self.
No, right?
Now, the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about you.
I've had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants.
And then, once you do that, you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way, instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in — and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.
I said, "What would you choose?"
Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams, but I think it's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people's real understanding.
And the second thing is it's about actually being in control, but in a very special way.
They look at Karajan.
We want to see the change.
It's done by geologists, engineers, biologists, all sorts of different people — modeling and simulation.
And experience of harder problems — being able to play with the math, interact with it, feel it.
"And what do you mean with Western world?"
I was 28, and like so many of us when we are in good health, I felt like I was invincible.
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing.
So, these were some of the earlier explorations I did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly.
Guess what fixed that.
The world presented me with options, and I took them.
When my doctor diagnosed me with conversion disorder, he was invoking a lineage of ideas about women's bodies that are over 2,500 years old.
(Applause ends)
Why do we have that belief?
And for the most part, the stories are recycled.
It takes some time to change for this, but on the axises, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have.
Uh, pear?
And you're playing a painful sound.
It's the same with the Chopin.
And also verify it — crucial step.
Sigmund Freud developed a theory that the unconscious mind could produce physical symptoms when dealing with memories or emotions too painful for the conscious mind to handle.
Glorious!
Do you know what I mean?
This is real, tangible change, real, tangible change.
When I come back to my desk, I can just pinch that information back to my desktop so I can use my full-size computer.
You can't look at this and say, "Now I see reality as it is."
You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life.
So if you go through lots of examples, you can get the answer, you can understand how the basics of the system work better.
(Music) His name was Lothar, Lothar Meggendorfer.
She has six years to live.
Chopin didn't want to reach the E there, because what will have happened?
But even between those three categories, it's too wide a gulf.
The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia.
These are hospitalized patients.
Now, there are two conditions in this experiment.
Now, weekend in Paris, weekend in Rome — these are different things.
Have I gotten the right one?
But what about the conductor?
So we gave them cameras; they went around campus; they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog, and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of.
Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing?
I've planted a hundred trees in a day.
Now, I don't know about you guys, but judging the circumstances, right, any judge in the whole world, would look at the statistics and the evidence, and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse.
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel, because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.
The labeling in this country is a disgrace.
Since, our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves — any street in California.
And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up.
I soon found myself a part of a cohort of women in their late 20s whose bodies were falling apart.
And by the way, she was also very insistent on being able to change the color, an important feature for this demonstration.
My name's Jamie Oliver.
We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology.
But now you can find out all about — unfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but — all about what happens.
And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life.
OK. Now I, like Ze Frank, can predict your next thought, which is, "Yeah, right."
And why only computers?
Well, let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac.
It's free cooking lessons, guys, in the Main Street.
They need to show us how to cook quick, tasty, seasonal meals for people that are busy.
He does something like this... (Laughter) And then — sort of — (Laughter) So not only the instruction is clear, but also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you.
And the title for my cookbook was going to be, "Dining Without Crumbs: The Art of Eating Over the Sink."
(Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done.
Ethan, congrats — quite the reaction.
How many years of protection do I need?
And as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house — the lights never go out.
Think about smoking.
He was the president of a corporation in Ohio.
See, in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.
I went to the eye of the storm.
We can do that with our children, too.
The cure was marriage and motherhood.
Like the hysteria of old, this has everything to do with gender and with whose stories we believe.
For example, one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine.
Because for me, to join the B to the E, I have to stop thinking about every single note along the way, and start thinking about the long, long line from B to E.
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self.
So what are the issues people bring up with this?
I thought I had a rare disease, something doctors had never seen.
Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic.
Let's just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk.
All right.
Now, this is not a good social science experiment, so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before.
Based on the people we've seen at TED, I would say you're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now.
And rather than go into statistics and trends, and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing, and the record companies that are folding, I thought we should do an experiment tonight.
Since then, there have been more than 70 outbreaks documented around the world, of a strikingly similar post-infectious disease.
Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it, or design it for that matter?
It's the perfect driving mechanism.
They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.
But at the end of this process, what I learned was that the nurses were wrong.
We stopped the world then.
So after being at MIT for a few years, I realized that writing academic papers is not that exciting.
He's fed up with burying his friends, his family, his community.
What was happening was the option that was useless, in the middle, was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it.
It's a means to an end, not an end in itself, and automation allows us to have that machinery.
They don't even get crockery.
And problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this.
He's pretty much covered them there.
Now I'm an activist, a human rights activist, and what drives me is my shame at living in an otherwise great nation that has less than five percent of the world's population but almost 25 percent of the world's incarcerated population.
Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one.
I do think it has to do with sexism, but I also think that fundamentally, doctors want to help.
Programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days, and it's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand.
Then there was more of a hump.
You have to educate the population.
Let's go back to the home.
What's different?
The silver lining is, I think, kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting.
She's 16 years old.
Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD.
Celery.
No cheating whatsoever.
What happens?
I'll think about it roughly.
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.
Who invented it?
But now, if you have an option that nobody wants, you can take it off, right?
Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world, but what we really need is, of course, a search function.
And the second, with an impulse every other note.
What happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way?
He gets bullied, for God's sake.
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question, maybe learn something about the world.
The label went away for me here.
I want you to think about illusion as a metaphor.
Giving organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society, how linked you are.
So now we're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we've lost on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.
We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways.
So, let's just think about, we got a problem here, we need to reboot.
I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one.
We're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real-world math.
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told, and he certainly wasn't the last.
— the world's first true inventor of the children's pop-up book.
What are these terms?
Now you get it.
I think it all started growing up in a fairly religious, moral family, eldest son of a rabbi, going off to university where I smoked some marijuana and I liked it.
So that's a good thing.
When I began investigating the history of my own disease, I was amazed to find how deep these ideas still run.
Data is often better than you think.
So this is a piece which goes from away to home.
I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany.
Home.
Of course they would.
Where else do you shop so religiously?
When they're out of education, they do it on a computer.
I've done anthropology on the main statistical units.
Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?
We don't want gangsters and guerrillas funded with illegal drug money terrorizing and taking over other nations.
Mexico, Australia, Germany, India, China, all have massive problems of obesity and bad health.
Every kid has the right to milk at school.
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?
And you have to guess my mind.
Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released.
It is a perfect custom prison.
(Laughter) All those great people here, virtuosos, they make noise, they need me to do that.
No bill ever disappeared.
The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time.
What do they do?
We're in a tipping-point moment.
And after all this, everyone paused; they took a step back.
Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD.
He has a heart of gold.
They don't often even look at the conductor.
I took this and I gave it to 100 MIT students.
Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing.
You're not really given any instructions, but the forces of the process itself keep you in place.
We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands, so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present.
I don't know how we got into this position.
They've got hair all over them.
This is the true experience of a live concert.
He had his laboratory tests, which always came back normal.
I'd say it's quite remarkable.
The Netherlands is on the left, and Belgium is on the right.
And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing.
Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.
The lunch ladies, the lunch cooks of America — I offer myself as their ambassador.
If I try to walk half a block, I might be bedridden for a week.
What's the purpose of school?
If your mother calls on the miserable telephone, she calls and says, "Hello," you not only know who it is, you know what mood she's in.
And for the rest of your life, every time you hear classical music, you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses.
(Laughter) Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world, but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.
There is no way for us not to see this illusion.
And you know if you walk across a chasm, you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all — bigger disaster.
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month.
It's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that.
But I'm killing them.
Which is why it's particularly galling to me as an American that we've been the driving force behind this global drug war.
Over the last 30 years, what's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country?
No, the fact is, America really is crazy when it comes to drugs.
Forklift.
Unfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him, because she never saw him again.

Here in Uganda, development aid.
There's other people who have kids, one's addicted to alcohol, the other one's addicted to cocaine or heroin, and they ask themselves the question: Why does this kid get to take one step at a time and try to get better and that one's got to deal with jail and police and criminals all the time?
I would love to share with you a story.
Is it still two types of countries?
The critics sitting in the back row there, they have to have an opinion, so they say, "Hamlet is a procrastinator."
We have the databases.
So again, the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work, and creative and all of that.
I made these up!
So let's see what's really going on here.
You have to make a choice.
We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia.
The answer lies over there.
See what happens here.
And the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent.
We need really to see it.
(Video) Who knows what this is?
10% the world population, most in poverty.
And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing.
First, we asked half the people to recall either 10 books they read in high school, or to recall The Ten Commandments, and then we tempted them with cheating.
Harry went back to New York, asked his brother, an investment banker, to loan him the $3,000, and his brother's immortal words were, "You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers."

Better yet, I'll check with you.
Another woman with ovarian cancer, who for years was told that it was just early menopause.
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.
People confuse, in my view, the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching.
Happiness!
He's sick of it.
And this is fantastic.
Now here's the crazy thing right now.

It turns out people do eat hamburgers, and Ray Kroc, for a while, became the richest man in America.
We build steps.
They came from here, a mineral country.
One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day.
Life skills.
And the United States up there is getting for longer life, keeping family size.
And the telephone.
Vegetably?
What do you do?
And I have pretty good news for you.
I walked back the two miles from my neurologist's office to my house, my legs wrapped in this strange, almost electric kind of pain.
The book starts like this.
And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar, just from milk.
So, my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene, exploded all of a sudden, and I started thinking about what is happening here.
But the moment you set this as the default, it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing.
They had muscle weakness, stiffness in the neck and back, fevers — all of the same symptoms I had when I first got diagnosed.

This is the income distribution of China, 1970.
The Roman physician Galen thought that hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation in particularly passionate women.
The general idea here, by the way, is that we actually don't know our preferences that well.
I use information, education.
So think about our global drug war not as any sort of rational policy, but as the international projection of a domestic psychosis.
Now, can we do that?
Now, look, if we do all this stuff, and we can, it's so achievable.
It's not the new database you need.
They would be right half of the cases.
I don't know.
Or have they got longer lives and live up there?
Did you see the hands?
Just give it a moment of thought.
The next day, my neurologist diagnosed with me conversion disorder.
What this is actually saying, is that many of these decisions are not residing within us.
A friend from college, whose brain tumor was misdiagnosed for years as anxiety.
Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing.
Animally?
And I often show this to senior management.

Everybody has a fantastic ear.
If you were tone-deaf, you couldn't change the gears on your car, in a stick shift car.
Yellow.
And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful.
What are you doing with this?
More generally, I want to tell you something about behavioral economics.
Now, how would you walk — my profession, the music profession doesn't see it that way.
Knives and forks?
This can't be done.
And if we move back again, here, and we put on trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first.
What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it?
Now, you may be wondering —
Don't touch the fruitcake!
Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic doesn't know when to play.
It's going to be people in their 40s and 60s and 80s who find they prefer a little marijuana to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill or that it helps with their arthritis or diabetes or maybe helps spice up a long-term marriage.
All around the world, ME is one of the least funded diseases.
And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do.
Your kids will be having milk at school, breakfast and lunch, right?
The tone-deaf people, they're no longer here.
Why did we do this?
These are the people who think they're tone-deaf.
I know ballet dancers who can't dance, accountants who can't add, medical students who never became doctors.
And it does, doesn't it?
Some of you are old enough to remember: he was the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done.
See, I think of calculating, in a sense, as the machinery of math.
The bottom one?
B, C, B, C, B, C, B — down to A, down to G, down to F. Almost goes to E, but otherwise the play would be over.
Now, in economic theory, cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.
It's still quicker to do that and more practical.
So, I was interested in these two rollers, and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend — never returned to him — and I now had four rollers.
Or maybe it's about religion.
I'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making.
Patients with epilepsy could be forcibly institutionalized until the EEG was able to measure abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
If anything, it made it more likely that those kids were put at risk.
And even being here — I mean, the last few days, I've known heights of obsessive behavior I never thought about.
And because we have no idea what to do, we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us.
Almost no overlap.
Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point, and you must have wondered what's the right approach.
This is why we have these four-minute dates.
Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time.
No, he was thinking about the vision for South Africa and for human beings.
I was training to be a social scientist.
Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life.
So, now we had a student — an acting student — that was a part of the group.
That's the first one.
When the five minutes were over, I would say, "Pass me the sheets of paper, and I'll pay you a dollar per question."
See, second time for the same player.
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market.
I thought I was very clever.
How are you feeling?
Now, why doesn't this take place?
We're evolutionarily designed to use vision.
We're not teaching our kids.
And the nurses told me two things.
And that changed everything for me.
We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another.
We've got one kid, here — having, you know, eight tablespoons of sugar a day.
I did exactly what I did with you, and I explained the whole thing.
Now, with marijuana, that obviously means legally regulating and taxing it like alcohol.
I estimated that, just today, across the world, we spent about 106 average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand.
The guy has no idea what to do.
Why not together?
Which is, you go onto a stage.
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here, which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.
And I can run it forward, like this.
And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world.
In Germany, scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity, and in Japan, of brain inflammation.
And if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such a terrible famine, lastly, it's like this.
I need you to understand it.
My neck was so stiff I couldn't touch my chin to my chest, and the slightest sound — the rustling of the sheets, my husband walking barefoot in the next room — could cause excruciating pain.
Now, how would you test a personal fudge factor?
As for the other drugs, look at Portugal, where nobody goes to jail for possessing drugs, and the government's made a serious commitment to treating addiction as a health issue.
We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier, and then we can take anything out.
"Yeah, right" is not the right response!
(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.
And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world.
That's my drug education mantra: Safety first.
Very, very hard.
Broccoli?
You'll see what happens when there is a mistake.
And they clearly cheated in a very, very serious way.
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.
So that's what I do: work to end the Drug War.
(Laughter) Yeah.
Let's get on schools, something that I'm fairly much a specialist in.
First of all, here's what students think is going to happen.
That's why the $100 computer will be so important.
The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on food culture, what made our society.
Here are three guys synthesizing happiness.
And what was true in my country, is true in so many others as well, with both the origins of these laws and their implementation.
I probably should have gone to the doctor, but I'd never really been sick in my life, and I knew that usually, if you have a virus, you stay home and you make some chicken soup, and in a few days, everything will be fine.
So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment.
I tell my students, "If you have a deceptive cadence, raise your eyebrows, and everybody will know."
We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents, a dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per correct question.
When I first got sick, old friends were reaching out to me.
It converted these emotions into physical symptoms.
And if you actually lose that information, it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind, that you suddenly feel like something's missing, except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.
In the 1950s, a psychiatrist named Eliot Slater studied a cohort of 85 patients who had been diagnosed with hysteria.
On the other hand, we can cheat a little bit, and still feel good about ourselves.
And if I now let the world move forward, you will see that while population increases, there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today.
So I started studying anthropology.
They're doing their best.
And later I can find a wall, anywhere, and start browsing those photos or maybe, "OK, I want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend."
I was a PhD student at Harvard, and I loved to travel.
I had studied statistics, probability theory, mathematical modeling, experimental design.
Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking, starting with posing the right question.
This is a bit of a difficult choice, because neither one is preferred strongly to the other, but naturally, people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four.
They said, "We can give you a franchise on this for 3,000 bucks."
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things — our own ability, how the economy works, how we should pay school teachers.
So, we did another experiment.
Here they go out of their regular, just to be part of that, to become part of the orchestra, and that's great.
Because in its 400 years of existence, storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device.
It's funny, isn't it?
They can't pick their print out of a lineup.
And look again at this Kleiber.
So we better be damn sure — and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them — so we better be damn sure that we know why we're doing that and it has a real purpose.
Is there a company being planned?
And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.
But in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time.
It's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer.
Now in some ways, given that you can have Rome with coffee, why would you possibly want Rome without coffee?
You know, it's local cooks teaching local people.
So I want to show you some cognitive illusions, or decision-making illusions, in the same way.
So then I published the 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos and budgets on a wiki.
So to be clear, what I really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual, simultaneously.
If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda.
The problem is they all want to roll out what they're doing to the next school, but there's no cash.
It turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity, I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower.
Closed.
And then you have other stories, unseen.
Yet doctors do not treat us and science does not study us.
So, we got people to sign, "I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code."
In more turgid prose, but closer to the truth, was the father of modern capitalism, Adam Smith, and he said this.
She's got six years to live because of the food that she's eaten.
But unless we start testing those intuitions, we're not going to do better.
And on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia.
It's like having your car stolen.
Now, that is something.
So you can open this one.
And so they're now becoming part of this drug policy reform movement.
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit, and they were insensitive to these economic incentives.
Between the time of onset and diagnosis, her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged, she will never be able to eat again.
Pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don't make real mistakes in planes.
Those trying to employ them think they don't know enough.
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as — who else?
You can take a data set and put it there.
You did not try ibuprofen.
Harry S. Langerman uttered these words, and he's somebody you might have known but didn't, because in 1949 he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned by two brothers named McDonalds.
You are.
"Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue."
Now it's the Russians leading the Drug War and not us.
You're telling the story.
And very, very simple.
But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income.
Maybe a little bit over-clear.
The audience gasped when they heard the difference.
People did this.
They're doing the best they can do.
It starts playing immediately.
This is our landscape of food.
But you see, when you're using a computer, you can just substitute.
How would you talk?
And that incites a sort of panic architecture — "Oh no, where's this thing?"
Some could still work, but had to spend their evenings and weekends in bed, just so they could show up the next Monday.
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.
The next note is a C. And the job of the C is to make the B sad.
Now, who should we thank for the success?
You know, audiences like you, yeah, make the event.
Now, when psychologists show you bars, you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people.
Well, in 1994, when Pete Best was interviewed — yes, he's still a drummer; yes, he's a studio musician — he had this to say: "I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles."
Because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows.
The answer was absolutely yes.
This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast.
And another thing about math: math sometimes looks like math — like in this example here — and sometimes it doesn't — like "Am I drunk?"
It turns out that freedom — the ability to make up your mind and change your mind — is the friend of natural happiness, because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy.
Maybe, "How about I take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information?"
The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here, I put fertility rate.
Did you see him turning pages in the score?
That's all.
Hi, my name is Marcin — farmer, technologist.
You know, I don't know how many of those you read, but it's not fun to read and often not fun to write — even worse to write.
She's eating her liver to death.
Conversely, think about cigarettes: Nothing can both hook you and kill you like cigarettes.
I don't know what would have happened had I not been one of the lucky ones, had I gotten sick before the internet, had I not found my community.
So if the eyes are shining, you know you're doing it.
We synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found.
But it wasn't useless in the sense that it helped people figure out what they wanted.
I don't think so — quite the opposite.
And this won't work.
Or, if you had to choose between the last two, which one would you choose?
The problem is that this can cause real harm.
But I am so grateful for how far I have come.
On that, I'm torn: three days a week I think yes, three days a week I think no, and on Sundays I'm agnostic.
Pizza for breakfast.
Basically, no one's very happy.
We've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools, period.
Our immune systems are just as much a battleground for equality as the rest of our bodies.
Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched.
Because you don't let us develop.
And this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences.
So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.
So that's why I study cyborg anthropology.
Thirty years ago, most of the food was largely local and largely fresh.
So, no, he doesn't want that.
We must be much more detailed.
What do you think Karajan's reply was?
I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.
We built the hardware and the software.
They have different food, different culture, different art.
Now, there's a similar situation in the classical music world, because there are some people who think that classical music is dying.
Chris, the most amazing thing that's happened of late is that I've met a growing number of people who have actually lost a sibling or a child to a drug overdose, and 10 years ago, those people just wanted to say, let's line up all the drug dealers and shoot them and that will solve it.
You have the plan in your head.
And we build these things that not everybody can use, obviously.
And I'll say, "Hmm, not sure."
I want to talk about something so basic as milk.
So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years.
From field studies to laboratory studies, we see that winning or losing an election, gaining or losing a romantic partner, getting or not getting a promotion, passing or not passing a college test, on and on, have far less impact, less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have.
And we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians.

He lost everything.
The Africans are the green here.
Are you going to come back to India with some of this, at some point?

You can care and be commercial.
And the other thing that happens is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.
And so this is the important point that I like to study: that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection — it's just done in a different way.
When our fears are bounded, we're prudent, we're cautious, we're thoughtful.
And of course, math is very powerful at doing that.
Watch as happiness is synthesized.
How could we care about something less than about something that happens after we die?
Second, don't do drugs.
The psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck, when we are trapped.
(Good luck.)
But it is a possibility to live into.
Now, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together, and maybe some others, you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.
It's a fantastic time to write, because there's so much feedback you can get from people.
Well, another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding.
Definitely they shouldn't be left out.
So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again.
The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there.
You let him go, or you pull him back?
Look.
What's the point of teaching people math?
Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life, but I can do something for all the people who died.
That's fantastic.
We have filled the void with something wonderful, but it is not enough.
And he said, "Well, okay."
And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them.
This almost floors me — a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago, with only a few exceptions, it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness.
Herbert von Karajan, please.
I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in, guys, OK?
It's the wrong chord.
I still don't know if I will ever be able to run again, or walk at any distance, or do any of those kinetic things that I now only get to do in my dreams.
Then there's another bigger group.
And you must have seen this illusion.
Go along with the video.
Nobody knew it was an actor.
I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre — they should do that.
Some of you will know it.
What is school?
And we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong.
It's the people I meet who have lost someone they love to drug-related violence or prison or overdose or AIDS because our drug policies emphasize criminalization over health.
One thing I often ask about is ancient Greek and how this relates.
Now, could we reduce smoking even more by making it totally illegal?
(Claps)
But last night, when you played that piece, he was the one I was thinking about.
Now that's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries.
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this.
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet, because in Enron, there's also a social element.
French fries are considered a vegetable.
Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?
How many lives could we save today if we decide to make a real start?
But Viennese audiences do not do that.
Maybe this isn't the good one?
Now, if we think about this in terms of the stock market, think about what happens.
When our fears are unbounded and overblown, we're reckless, and we're cowardly.
Now that's great.
You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture.
There is plenty of beautiful things going on.
I've been doing this for seven years.
I meditated on that pain, contemplating how my mind could have possibly generated all this.
Twenty-five percent of us are homebound or bedridden, and 75 to 85 percent of us can't even work part-time.
There, the Internet is coming.
But it gave me hope that I could be treated.
We have wonderful design tools, and more and more are added up here.
Instead, we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one, two and four — conceptualizing problems, applying them, getting the teacher to run them through how to do that.
Here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience, and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time.
And when we see cheating around us, particularly if it's a part of our in-group, cheating goes up.
OK, I see it as a triangle, OK?
We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here.
Did it answer the question?
Now, think about what this means.
And so what happens is, when we bring all that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time.
We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert.
And they remembered a man, one amazing German, every time a new storytelling device popped up next.
That's the first group, quite small.
So I think practicality is one case where it's worth teaching people by hand.
It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?
OK, school.
And this is particularly interesting, because MIT doesn't have an honor code.
The first one is Jim Wright.
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper.

If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve, but I wouldn't give you enough time.
These are the market shares — most people wanted the combo deal.
And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open, which is basically your Facebook wall, so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night — because it's very much the equivalent.
Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years.

We'll have most people in the middle.
So he went to find them.
We wake up in the morning and we open the closet; we feel that we decide what to wear.
Let's start with the Main Street.
And who are these?
The problem with the theory of hysteria or psychogenic illness is that it can never be proven.
And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part, called the "frontal lobe."
Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.
You know, you've come home from a long day, and you take a glass of wine, and you put your feet up.
That's what happened.
When our ambition is unbounded, it leads us to lie, to cheat, to steal, to hurt others, to sacrifice things of real value.
If their eyes are shining, you know you're doing it.
Then pretty soon, I was broke too.
This is the GDP per capita.
We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways.
Let's try it again.
At the end, they went crazy, clapping.
Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.
So I decided to do the experiment that I would have loved The Economist to do with me.
And we open up so many more possibilities.
You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought.
And it turns out it's a more general case — there's a lot of mistakes we do.
He goes back up to B, he gets very excited.
The countries on the left have a form at the DMV that looks something like this.
It's not true.
I kept on doing this for a while.
So we said, "If people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations, to these forces, what could be going on?"
And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error, and can therefore be prevented by machines?
I don't think so.
Now, what's the right response to that?
Not quite a complete standing O, though, and I'm guessing that some people here and maybe a few watching online, maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend or whatever who got sick, maybe died from some drug overdose.
He'd spent 37 years in a Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn't commit.
That makes it roughly twice as common as multiple sclerosis.
Somebody goes to another country, says, "How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are, how curious their culture is."

You see, the first time, he was playing with an impulse on every note.
And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet.
It's not feedback.
And if we can do that, if we can approach the great vastness of all that we do not know, and then, rather than fear uncertainty, maybe we can greet it with a sense of wonder.
Our intuition is really fooling us in a repeatable, predictable, consistent way.

Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit.
Just feeling really sad and depressed right now.
It's actually very popular.
It's driving itself.
Okay.
I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work.
But many of you argue, actually, that all of our work is not only about physical objects.
Lots of learning.
And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open.
