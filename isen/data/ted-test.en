This is Mao Tse-tung.
I could use a new print.
(Laughter) Because you didn't know when to play.
We can just play with papers.
Let's be honest, guys, you haven't got that cash.
And this is Latin America.
And so this is very important.
You also have to be very professional.
Is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things, or are we talking a more endemic situation, that many people are actually capable of behaving this way?
What would happen to the other people in the group?
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway?
Let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate.
But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.
I had just gotten engaged to marry the love of my life.
It's very, very preventable.
It took some person years, and we have produced animations.
We were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number.
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment, and we prepaid them.
I gave it to another 100 students.
Can we do it in another way?
These ideas went largely unchanged for several millennia until the 1880s, when neurologists tried to modernize the theory of hysteria.
Now what does Riccardo Muti do?
Next video, please.
So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960.
Which is why putting criminal laws and police front and center in trying to control a dynamic global commodities market is a recipe for disaster.
Once it has that information, it finds out more reviews about that, or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that, so you can actually hear, on a physical book, a review as sound.
So, what I did here is remove the camera — All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera.
For me, there isn't any need to flavor the milk.
You can stand on one side of the world, whisper something and be heard on the other.
There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore.
And one of the reasons it's so important — so it's very important to get computers in exams.
But just imagine the drug war nightmare that would result.
I paid to get it repaired — then it broke again.
We heard it in other forms.
What, in this kind of climate?
I mean, don't forget, Coca-Cola had cocaine in it until 1900, and so far as we know was no more addictive than Coca-Cola is today.
But I think we can do both at the same time here.
That's a different kind of control.
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that.
You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.
These things feel very differently.
We will provide all the open source software for them, maybe starting next month.
And it wasn't that difficult.
And then we can ask questions, real questions, questions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get?
I end now with the world.
You bring in, say, six objects, and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked.
Here, I'm taking a part of a document, and putting over here a second part from a second place, and I'm actually modifying the information that I have over there.
You know what to do.
I have good news that the present, new Head of U.N. Statistics, he doesn't say it's impossible.
The ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice, a choice made by the institutions that were supposed to protect us.
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student.
He said, "Well, you just bend time and space, it takes an awful lot of energy, and that's just how you do it."
Maybe, but it's not going to be young people, because it's not going to be legalized for them, and quite frankly, they already have the best access to marijuana.
I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.
Big companies.
It's a marvelous adaptation.
Like the bird who flies over the field and doesn't care about the fences underneath, all right?
Let's look at the first video.
But we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of America, OK?
Seventy-five percent of autoimmune disease patients are women, and in some diseases, it's as high as 90 percent.
They remember their childhood, but if you walk in and introduce yourself, and then leave the room, when you come back, they don't know who you are.
Interpretation is the real story of the performer.
This isn't some optional extra.
There's our carton.
Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs, and a year after winning the lotto, lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives.
Yemen, civil war.
The camera is actually tracking all your gestures.
Bring that person into your mind, and at the same time, follow the line all the way from B to E, and you'll hear everything that Chopin had to say.
You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.
Doctors, scientists and policy makers are not immune to the same biases that affect all of us.
You want a slightly uglier version of yourself.
India?
I realized that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet.
They cheat just by a little bit, all the same.
A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world.
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.
They say three percent of the population likes classical music.
And the country that does this first will, in my view, leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even, an improved economy, an improved outlook.
Fast food.
Is there any realistic chance of anything actually shifting on this issue in the next five years?
Act One, scene three, he finds out his uncle killed his father.
Well, what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species.
The question is, why?
But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics.
Here's why this worries me: since the 1950s, rates of many autoimmune diseases have doubled to tripled.
I would walk straight into door frames.
With the fast-food industry you know, it's very competitive.
It's a catastrophe.
I can split South Asia here.
So think about these two tables.
Sierra Leone down there.
A greater distribution of the means of production, environmentally sound supply chains, and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity.
This stuff goes through you and your family's body every week.
So I decided to try and write something more fun.
But he's spreading happiness.
And think of the outside world.
And ultimately, I think that boils down to the kids, and to every parent's desire to put our baby in a bubble, and the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble and put our young ones at risk.
But what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this?
So, you think these are potatoes?
Businesses of America need to support Mrs. Obama to do the things that she wants to do.
And so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow.
That seems like a one-question IQ test.
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology, and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.
In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70.
And teachers are also frustrated.
And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?
ME has never benefited from the kind of science that other diseases have had, but that's starting to change.
Sadly, in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat, four Americans that are alive will be dead through the food that they eat.
This is a myth.
Doctors thought it was a new form of polio.
It's a very small increase, and it doesn't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition.
I was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.
Here's the good part: despite everything, I still have hope.
Ethan, thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal.
Brown.
Think about it for yourself.
So I want to see a completely renewed, changed math curriculum built from the ground up, based on computers being there, computers that are now ubiquitous almost.
I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there.
Hello?
So, please.
When Muti is asked, "Why do you conduct like this?"
(Video) Man: Oh, my God.
We can say, "Oh, these funny Europeans, of course it would influence them."
In one case, the students are told, "But you know, if you want to change your mind, I'll always have the other one here, and in the next four days, before I actually mail it to headquarters," — yeah, "headquarters" — "I'll be glad to swap it out with you.
What did it were higher taxes and time and place restrictions on sale and use and effective anti-smoking campaigns.
Do you rip it off quickly — short duration but high intensity — or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly — you take a long time, but each second is not as painful — which one of those is the right approach?
And now, if you see, it's more about the cost-effectiveness: this system costs you $300 compared to the $20,000 surface tables, or anything like that.
My friend Peter says, "If you love something, give it away."
And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.
Who am I being, that my children's eyes are not shining?
So another one that comes up is "Computers dumb math down."
Don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz, because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time.
How much money do you spend, in your life, in a supermarket?
Now is the time when it's ripe — ripe for the picking.
And what they've come to understand is that the Drug War did nothing to protect their kids.
Did you see this kind of movement?
You look at their eyes.
I'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device, because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own.
So, technically, it's a little bit complex, but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use, in some sense.
Well, it is different.
My brain is not what it used to be.
If my husband goes for a run, he might be sore for a couple of days.
No cynicism.
Whether storytellers realized it or not, they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville, radio news to radio theater, film to film in motion to film in sound, color, 3D, on VHS and on DVD.
If they want sad music, they just play those two notes.
It's my music.
ME affects children and ME affects millions of men.
What happens now?
You know, when it's needed, the authority is there.
But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving.
But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next.
Romantic, yes, but most importantly, it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference.
Among all these experiments, there was one thing in common: I was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world.
(Laughter) And I liked drinking too, but it was obvious that alcohol was really the more dangerous of the two, but my friends and I could get busted for smoking a joint.
And the question was, will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective, more attractive brothers?
But evolutionarily, two million years is nothing.
The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives.
It was totally life-changing.
When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident.
Math is a much broader subject than calculating.
I found it.
And recently, we used to think that stomach ulcers were just caused by stress, until we discovered that H. pylori was the culprit.
And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
And what do we hear when we go around?
I can animate the lines.
Because pixels are actually, right now, confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets.
So I printed another version of this, where I eliminated the middle option.
It's my country's history with alcohol prohibition and Al Capone, times 50.
You lot, you're all right, but we'll get you eventually, don't worry.
The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data.
Very good for the physicians.
If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.
And what has happened?
Can we have the next video, quickly?
Imagine I added a choice to the set that nobody wanted.
Would you think of somebody who you adore, who's no longer there?
That chord doesn't work.
But if you look at this plot, you can see that countries that we think about as very similar, actually exhibit very different behavior.
They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket.
Under the circumstances, it's profoundly important that every single American child leaves school knowing how to cook 10 recipes that will save their life.
At one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat.
We do so much in the kitchen, I thought this would be interesting.
As soon as I walked through the door, I collapsed.
And he said one day, "What's the shortest distance between two points?"
You could light up a village with this guy's eyes.
Sometime later — it could be 15 minutes; it could be 15 days — the same stimuli are put before the subject, and the subject is asked to re-rank the stimuli.
And then he backs away, he goes up to him again, almost kills him.
It basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in donating their organs.
So automation allows this separation and also allows — in the case of driving, and I believe also in the future case of maths — a democratized way of doing that.
That was after having spent about 20 years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa, so I was sort of expected to know a little about the world.
But it was a little bit boring.
And let's understand: this is not an incremental sort of change.
And of course, I wanted to know whether I was doing that.
It wasn't that the more religious people — the people who remembered more of the Commandments — cheated less, and the less religious people — the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments — cheated more.
For decades, that's a name that's meant that this has been the dominant image of a disease that can be as serious as this.
I was taking some part of the objects, or any of the intuitiveness of real life, and bringing them to the digital world, because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive.
Can't even get them out the door, and I'm being serious.
Rather than typing a keyword to find something, I put my objects on top of it.
And you look at Lenny and he's suffering.
Then I thought, "Why not make a Google Map, but in the physical world?"
For the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are.
So everybody's understanding, the Drug War's not protecting anybody.
What actually happened was the impulses were reduced.
And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.
This is a normal family, guys.
Waste of life.
I needed tools that were robust, modular, highly efficient and optimized, low-cost, made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime, not designed for obsolescence.
So here's the final piece of this experiment.
So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy, and I discovered I was useless.
And as one patient told me, we get it coming and going — if you're a woman, you're told you're exaggerating your symptoms, but if you're a guy, you're told to be strong, to buck up.
But milk ain't good enough anymore.
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.
In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice.
And then you feel even worse.
So, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made, around eight years back, in 2000.
Then the neurological symptoms started.
He wouldn't lend him the money, and of course, six months later Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea.
It's just simply not part of your life.
Living with this illness has taught me that science and medicine are profoundly human endeavors.
Goes to E. It's the wrong chord.
Paper world is interesting to play with.
Why are we not using the data we have?
If you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it.
Who are these characters who are so damn happy?
Right.
Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear, so complete, that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit.
It's not a physical thing.
When my neurologist gave me that diagnosis in 2012, he was echoing Freud's words verbatim, and even today, women are 2 to 10 times more likely to receive that diagnosis.
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.
They're not just sitting there.
There is a lot of energy here.
If America does it, other people will follow.
And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent.
The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas.
What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States.
So this is what I've dedicated my life to, to building an organization and a movement of people who believe we need to turn our backs on the failed prohibitions of the past and embrace new drug policies grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights, where people who come from across the political spectrum and every other spectrum as well, where people who love our drugs, people who hate drugs, and people who don't give a damn about drugs, but every one of us believes that this War on Drugs, this backward, heartless, disastrous War on Drugs, has got to end.
This was not just lightning.
Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving.
Come winter, three times as many people die.
What about this?
And there is Latin America.
How many lives could we have saved, decades ago, if we had asked the right questions?
The poorest are down there.
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor.
"I am so much better off physically, financially, mentally and in almost every other way."
That's stage two.
Around America, if we just look back now, there is plenty of wonderful things going on.
But now, Bangladesh — it's a miracle that happens in the '80s: the imams start to promote family planning.
(Laughter) "Do you understand what this guy wants?"
We devoured what research there was.
And this is what happens: the data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy.
And the public is there, and the Internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively.
And if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision, which we're so good at, what are the chances we won't make even more mistakes in something we're not as good at, for example, financial decision-making.
What was striking was just how much trouble we were having being taken seriously.
What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really, truly changed their affective, hedonic, aesthetic reactions to that poster.
It turns out it would have been better to start with my face, which was much more painful, and move toward my legs, giving me a trend of improvement over time — that would have been also less painful.
But they're doing what they're told, and what they're being told to do is wrong.
(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape.
Huntington's Kitchen.
Rather than using a keyboard and mouse, why can I not use my computer in the same way that I interact in the physical world?
Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser?
Your FM is always on that classical dial.
And in front of all that noise, you do a very small gesture.
It's estimated that about 15 to 30 million people around the world have this disease.
Ask why so many countries criminalize drugs they'd never heard of, why the U.N. drug treaties emphasize criminalization over health, even why most of the money worldwide for dealing with drug abuse goes not to helping agencies but those that punish, and you'll find the good old U.S. of A.
So, I started this exploration around eight years back, and it literally started with a mouse on my desk.
You can do so many more problems.
Not as the myth is.
Now, Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system, so we said, "Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?"
I would pay people four dollars for their task — on average people would solve four problems.
So our true challenge is to learn how to live with drugs so they cause the least possible harm and in some cases the greatest possible benefit.
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis.
There's our milk.
People get annoyed.
Germany is on the left, and Austria is on the right.
Yeah.
So my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?"
They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math.
One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.
I took it very literally, and took my bike helmet, put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely.
And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries.
Do you remember?
Then we set out to create an open source, DIY, do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost.
So, I am very interested, from the beginning, how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures, and how we use these objects, can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world.
This is the result that has been replicated over and over again.
And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.
And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world, beyond virtually any other part of doing math.
No he doesn't really mean Him.
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student — he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student — but he was a part of their group, cheating went up.
You know, we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions.
These are the data.
Same principles applied — calculations, harder.
All I can say is: I care.
Well, can you do it with less control, or with a different kind of control?
(Video) Famous talk at Harvard University —
She's obese before she even gets to primary school.
The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong.
Every single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease.
The conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound.
It's pretty scary.
So I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room, downstairs and in Aspen, and everybody else looking, will come to love and understand classical music.
And I learned two interesting things.
And we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least.
The countries on the right, the ones that give a lot, have a slightly different form.
(Music)
Unlike most of our computing devices, these objects are much more fun to use.
So, everybody can rank these Monet prints from the one they like the most, to the one they like the least.
Let's do it.
Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies, but don't know how to fix it.
We could do it so that when you take the two pictures, you'd have four days to change your mind, or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it.
But, you know, I want my kids to succeed in life and this isn't going to get them there.
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, there was the book.
By the end of the year, the family planning started in Vietnam; they went for smaller families.
I'm really worried that, especially kids today, they're not going to be dealing with this down-time, that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture, and that everything comes to them, and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.
"I believe it turned out for the best."
If I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is.
Portion size is obviously a massive, massive problem.
I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees.
Over the years we've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically.
That day, I ran a small experiment.
Like this.
We want to know about things.
And I did this with them — a risky thing to do, because they were street kids.
These are the people that you have access to right now, in general — all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.
So, as a last thought, I think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide, the gap between these two worlds, but will also help us, in some way, to stay human, to be more connected to our physical world.
For example: mental arithmetic.
When you walk into the DMV, the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing.
This is incredible, really.
That's a totally different world.
Dilbert already knows, of course.
Do you realize that you, TED users, spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic, wasting your time on your daily commute?
So nobody is tone-deaf.
For me, it's very simple.
You wouldn't have expected that a few years back.
With all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard, a shopping mall full of Zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable, because they don't want stuff enough.
So at one end we've got falling interest in education in math, and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world, a more quantitative world than we ever have had.
Hip replacement.
It turns out that they got to 28 percent after mailing every household in the country a letter, begging people to join this organ donation program.
Any doctor, any specialist will tell you that.
Now, also, back to the sort of big brands: labeling, I said earlier, is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted.
They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.
And Ghana is here in the middle.
We're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information, and we can't keep up.
I'm 34 years old.
Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years.
It has helped us to extend our physical selves, go faster, hit things harder, and there's been a limit on that.
So, maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over, but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree, as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.
Almost like a ghost, isn't it?
But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous.
They are residing in the person who is designing that form.
Thanks.
Now, the interesting thing about this is when I take the lines away, it's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute.
"What are you doing?"
You can't imagine your life without classical music.
I'll tell you something else I learned, that the reason some drugs are legal and others not has almost nothing to do with science or health or the relative risk of drugs, and almost everything to do with who uses and who is perceived to use particular drugs.
1,600 people, busy people, involved in all sorts of different things, listening, understanding and being moved by a piece by Chopin.
Other times I wouldn't be able to speak or move at all.
And, actually, if you see, there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it.
It's a 50-year-old paradigm called the "free choice paradigm."
And you know, I have a definition of success.
And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data.
I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.
What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.
And just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition, and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions.
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it, and I would crunch it a little bit.
Where there is a demand, there will be a supply.
Well, it's very simple.
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference?
How are they?
And what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them?
They don't like their picture, and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired, they still don't like their picture.
It's not that.
When I was in Huntington, trying to get a few things to work when they weren't, I thought "If I had a magic wand, what would I do?"
I put them together, so that in each pair of country, one has twice the child mortality of the other.
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home, compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box?
It's the chore.
Right?
The moment you add Rome without coffee, Rome with coffee becomes more popular, and people choose it.
It's very important.
But I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside.
(Laughter) But I'll tell you how they do it.
We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that I could ever imagine with computers.
Moreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of.
This is the difference between dating and marriage.
About 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students.
We're going to give you one as your prize to take home.
We've got to put back what's been lost.
Everything in this world exists in Africa.
See, the thing we're doing right now is we're forcing people to learn mathematics.
And as a consequence, people chose it.
Hmm... again.
Will they cheat more, or will they cheat less?
Thank you very much.
But one late night, when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery.
But in education it looks very different — dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating, mostly by hand.
And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival.
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone, the room would be very crowded.
I used to be a professor teaching about this.
Because here's what's really happening.
Well, traditional definition is "an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments."
Basics of what?
So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast — and we're on the West coast, building the software — takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text.
We use our vision more hours of the day than anything else.
And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.
The lesson I want to leave you with, from these data, is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown, because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience.
Let's see how your experience simulators are working.
What does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth?
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments — and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments — but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments, given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.
First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.
It's good people who have lost their jobs, their homes, their freedom, even their children to the state, not because they hurt anyone but solely because they chose to use one drug instead of another.
My estimation is that probably 45 of you are absolutely passionate about classical music.
We should have a 'Fifth Sense' for missing-sense people who cannot speak.
So now, you're going to follow the line all the way from B to E. And I've one last request before I play this piece all the way through.
That's the second group.
(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.
"I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change."
She told me this.
Do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?
But then one author arrived, and he changed the game forever.
But the more interesting thing was that I started learning from people.
As the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book.
I know it sounds silly, but you have to find a way to explain things like this to yourself, and so I thought maybe I was just aging.
All of these would have been great things to do, and my nurses had no idea.
So that's when I started reading everything I could about psychoactive drugs: the history, the science, the politics, all of it, and the more one read, the more it hit you how a thoughtful, enlightened, intelligent approach took you over here, whereas the politics and laws of my country were taking you over here.
It's not that we're always connected to everybody, but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.
And here is the story.
He's at the sharp knife-edge of this problem.
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too.
But here and there and that.
I had no practical skills.
You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome.
Thankfully, nobody wanted the dominant option.
Marissa, her father died in her hand, I think she'd be quite happy if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly.
When researchers ask heroin addicts what's the toughest drug to quit, most say cigarettes.
And then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating, but I think they're relatively small in number.
The Greeks thought the uterus would literally dry up and wander around the body in search of moisture, pressing on internal organs — yes — causing symptoms from extreme emotions to dizziness and paralysis.
Now, he tries E again.
Now, what has happened since 1962?
You have to train health staff.
And the thing would be to get up the databases free, to get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them.
And I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook.
"Why complain about getting free paper?"
The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities, Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.
People see each other behaving.
No, they're too dangerous.
People say, "Is such and such true?"
In fact, sometimes it seems like the entire War on Drugs gets justified as one great big child protection act, which any young person can tell you it's not.
"Glorious," a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience.
When ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular.
These are normal controls, where if I did this with you, all of you would know which print you chose.
Two-thirds of this room, today, in America, are statistically overweight or obese.
And this was a cause for celebration.
I showed some people a picture of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.
For some people, we varied how much money they could get away with — how much money they could steal.
Labeling is a massive problem.
(Laughter) Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts.
It's because, without leaving your armchair, you can simulate that flavor and say "yuck" before you make it.
There's no gap between rich and poor any longer.
But later, I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels, also.
And all you put together, in partnership, brings about the best music.
Isn't that nice?
But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt, cheating went down.
And it works the exact same way.
So clear.
So, what have we learned from this about cheating?
The nine-year-old put an impulse on every four notes.
But it's the best music making, like this.
Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online, and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there.
But the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.
I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek, but I don't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient Greek.
This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.
I guess maybe if you're colorblind, I don't think you can see that.
The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything.
Now like a Karajan.
So what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up, and what can we do to fix it?
We created a black-and-white photography course, and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom.
In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries.
Chris, thanks so much.
Okay so, in my world, what do we need to do?
That's my belief.
And when it burst, the size of its country bubble is the size of the population.
Here is what happens.
Can we have a little demonstration?
But it's like an experiment.
And if you pull him back, do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam?
It didn't feel true, but I knew from my training that the truth is often counterintuitive, so easily obscured by what we want to believe.
What?
Think about the following intuition.
"Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program."
And of course, it turns into a circle.
Virtually every society has ingested psychoactive substances to deal with pain, increase our energy, socialize, even commune with God.
Well, modern-day life.
Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today?
Will more people use marijuana?
So what's a good definition for cyborg?
And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this.
But authority is not enough to make people your partners.
We've driven in cities, like in San Francisco here.
It's the only way.
When should I start?
See, normally in school, you do things like solve quadratic equations.
What about the eyes?
If you don't believe me, you can get the slide later and do some arts and crafts and see that they're identical.
Here's an experiment we did at Harvard.
And what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore.
No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.
Now, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples — a few people cheated a lot.
And the first marijuana prohibition laws, all about fears of Mexican migrants in the West and the Southwest.
Though I'm going to show you some experimental evidence, you don't have to look very far for evidence.
Stop.
But these aren't the data.
That's great!
Actually, I hear a lot, "My husband is tone-deaf."
Similar, but slightly uglier.
And it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines.
If it were that, I would just save you the talk, and teach you the gesture.
OK. We, the adults of the last four generations, have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents.
I was quite excited about this.
So calculus has traditionally been taught very late.
Your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that we've built around them.
Look at this, please.
I've been trying in America for seven years.
Other people I would tempt to cheat.
(Music) Now something else.
Our tools are being made for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker.
And this person was very forceful and said, "Look, that's the only way you'll ever do it."
Look here in Brazil, and some other countries, where a remarkable psychoactive substance, ayahuasca, can be legally bought and consumed provided it's done so within a religious context.
It has everything on this Earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin America.
I would spend most of the next two years in bed.
In fact, every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating.
You know, the amount of additives, E numbers, ingredients you wouldn't believe — there's not enough veggies at all.
So I did a pre-test when they came.

And now the project is beginning to grow on its own.
And after a second or two, carefully reflecting, she said, "No paper?"
The staff are the moms and dads of America's children.
You could regain this time.
And you weigh these options out — you do the simple cost-benefit analysis, and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not.
She's the third generation of Americans that hasn't grown up within a food environment where they've been taught to cook at home or in school, or her mom, or her mom's mom.
Put it this way, and I exaggerate only slightly: If the principal smokers of cocaine were affluent older white men and the principal consumers of Viagra were poor young black men, then smokable cocaine would be easy to get with a prescription from your doctor and selling Viagra would get you five to 10 years behind bars.
Vision is one of the best things we do.
Many had undiagnosed conditions like multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, brain tumors.
Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.
You know, we were just in South Africa, and you can't go to South Africa without thinking of Mandela in jail for 27 years.
India's the big bubble in the middle.
You're using us as instruments, not as partners.
I probably would have already taken my own life, as so many others have done.
In fact, I even talk about us moving from what we often call now the "knowledge economy" to what we might call a "computational knowledge economy," where high-level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is.
And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.
The big brands, you know, the food brands, need to put food education at the heart of their businesses.
I'm sure you've had these people approach you before.
As a challenge to myself, since I say this once in a while in lectures, I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness.
So, five years ago, this was me.
Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there.
I truly believe that change will happen.
They move up into that corner.
Mauritius is up there.
You can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer.
Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families.
He did not survive.
Look at the murder and mayhem in Mexico, Central America, so many other parts of the planet, the global black market estimated at 300 billion dollars a year, prisons packed in the United States and elsewhere, police and military drawn into an unwinnable war that violates basic rights, and ordinary citizens just hope they don't get caught in the crossfire, and meanwhile, more people using more drugs than ever.
Let's see another super-conductor, a German super-conductor.
Here's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate.
But let me split sub-Saharan Africa.
And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods, and pain that went up and pain that went down, and with breaks and without breaks — all kinds of versions of pain.
Most politicians in my country want to roll back the Drug War now, put fewer people behind bars, not more, and I'm proud to say as an American that we now lead the world in reforming marijuana policies.
You might be surprised having seen Kleiber as such a hyperactive guy.
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students.
Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem.
I mean, look, the markets in marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine are global commodities markets just like the global markets in alcohol, tobacco, coffee, sugar, and so many other things.
And yet in two million years, the human brain has nearly tripled in mass, going from the one-and-a-quarter pound brain of our ancestor here, Habilis, to the almost three-pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears.
How much do I stand to gain from cheating?
It doesn't work for me to go on with this thing, with such a wide gulf between those who understand, love and are passionate about classical music, and those who have no relationship to it at all.
People aren't supposed to be there.
We have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward, and also our societies, based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics.
(Music) Look at the eyes.
Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, "What do you really think about the world?"
It can be the other buttock.
He took a piece of paper, drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched.
Do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get?
When you have 21 minutes to speak, two million years seems like a really long time.
The general point is that, when we think about economics, we have this beautiful view of human nature.
This is one of my favorites.
So for the past year and a half, my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book.
They just sell us what we want.
Look at homicide at the bottom, for God's sake.
Let's be frank and honest.
Stacy does her best, but she's third-generation as well; she was never taught to cook at home or at school.
The publicly-funded data is down here.
So that's what we're going to do.
Very hard to think that it would influence us.
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time.
And I go on the podium.
I even saw a psychiatrist.
So, in order to realize this dream, I actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head.
Some people shredded everything, went out of the room, and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.
(Laughter) And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.
So I decided to do this experiment with people.
And after doing that, they really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together.
There is an orchestra sitting.
But how does it happen?
We explained we would have number three mailed to them.
(Cheering) They were happy because the story survived, and that the world would keep on spinning.
So let me tell you a story.
— real questions that people have in their everyday lives.
What does the inside of your computer actually look like?
In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.
So this is what I could display here.
And then I went online and found thousands of people all over the world living with the same symptoms, similarly isolated, similarly disbelieved.
For the other people, I added an ugly version of Tom.
We became our own scientists and our own doctors because we had to be.
"I am so much better off physically, financially, emotionally, mentally and almost every other way."
I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.
But here I am today, with you, and that is a miracle.
The camera is actually doing — just, getting all the images — is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside.
But by and large, that's not it.
The question is, are we going to test those intuitions?
Not really.
So, there are lots of companies, sponsor companies of Media Lab interested in taking this ahead in one or another way.
And about three years later, when I left the hospital, I started studying at the university.
When I'm going back, I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed, because at that particular time, I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone, and checking out a particular icon.
Now it's about you, the player, telling the story.
The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother.
And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the Internet users per 1,000.
Now, what happened was not maybe what you thought, which is, he suddenly became passionate, engaged, involved, got a new teacher, he hit puberty, or whatever it is.
A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee, or where you can trash the cup.
There's probably never been a drug-free society.
But this is hypothesis-generating.
"Aaaaaah," and I stop you.
Now it's a reversed thing.
He depends, for his power, on his ability to make other people powerful.
Look in Bolivia and Peru, where all sorts of products made from the coca leaf, the source of cocaine, are sold legally over the counter with no apparent harm to people's public health.
Very simple example.
All of these outbreaks have tended to disproportionately affect women, and in time, when doctors failed to find the one cause of the disease, they thought that these outbreaks were mass hysteria.
We gathered up our materials and we went out of the room, and counted to a half hour.
And it's so complex that we don't know what to do.
It's the future.
I felt like I couldn't just reject my neurologist's diagnosis.
So I thought, around last year — in the beginning of the last year — I started thinking, "Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way?"
Here's what normal controls do: they synthesize happiness.
Now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives, extra ingredients, and you know the rest of the story.
It's about how many shining eyes I have around me.
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill?
Normal.
If you can cook, time doesn't matter.
Yes, it works — to a certain point.
I know they were close, but not that close.
Lunch?
A message written on a sticky note to my mom, on paper, can come to an SMS, or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar — a to-do list that automatically syncs with you.
You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme — and very small sides and a very large number of sides.
I'm a scientist, so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric, but by marinating you in a little bit of data.
I'm here.
And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it, and we think it's very exotic.
This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way.
Let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income.
When we get bigger distance from cheating, from the object of money, for example, people cheat more.
But the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go.
It's an honor to have you at TED.
In math education, we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand.
Do you know what that is?
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments, they stopped cheating.
So we started a nonprofit venture which, linking data to design, we called Gapminder, from the London Underground, where they warn you, "mind the gap."
I won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa.
So, more interestingly, I'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way.
The telephone.
I can split Arab states.
But, in fact, it's not because it's easy.
This is very exciting for those players.
It's China there, moving against better health there, improving there.
But I tell you what.
Calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years.
And yet, all of us have this psychological immune system, this capacity to synthesize happiness, but some of us do this trick better than others.
In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily.
Who knows what that is?
If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker, the only thing you can do in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit.
What do you think this is?
That's probably the largest group.
A third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.
That's in order to delay — until Act Five, he can kill him.
And many of you are excited about the next-generation tablet computers to come out in the market.
Multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed as hysterical paralysis until the CAT scan and the MRI discovered brain lesions.
This one shows the wind potential all around the United States.
I'll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior.
But whatever the countries on the right are doing, they're doing a much better job than begging.
Nobody is.
It is by definition the absence of evidence, and in the case of ME, psychological explanations have held back biological research.
When you talk about objects, one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing, and that is gestures: how we manipulate these objects, how we use these objects in everyday life.
We want to know about dynamic things going around.
You have a fantastic ear.
And then like Karajan.
So you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy.
A system of cognitive processes, largely non-conscious cognitive processes, that help them change their views of the world, so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves.
You stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall.
What is it that we want to ask?
Well, I did this at a school in Boston with about 70 seventh graders, 12-year-olds.
How would you walk or talk?
And he said, "That is the shortest distance between two points."
We've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist — things from tractors, bread ovens, circuit makers.
And then finally — you know, the best of all possible worlds — some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best, who was the original drummer for the Beatles, until they, you know, sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour.
Now, you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work, if you look at my face, right?
That's a view of the world that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this.
But in the last few decades that has totally changed.
You have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience.
I was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis.
Ready?
It's in everything.
She enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops."
Look at Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, England, where people who have been addicted to heroin for many years and repeatedly tried to quit and failed can get pharmaceutical heroin and helping services in medical clinics, and the results are in: Illegal drug abuse and disease and overdoses and crime and arrests all go down, health and well-being improve, taxpayers benefit, and many drug users even put their addictions behind them.
And he cues in a flute player like this.
66 percent of the students, two-thirds, prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind.
Third, if you do do drugs, there's some things I want you to know, because my bottom line as your parent is, come home safely at the end of the night and grow up and lead a healthy and good adulthood.
You shouldn't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject.
We find that students get very excited when they can use this.
But otherwise, you never hear it.
What can you say the conductor was doing, actually?
So one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams.
And slowly I added five percent here, five percent there, until eventually, on a good day, I was able to leave my home.
Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent.
I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible.
But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures, we are at risk.
We call this like a personal fudge factor.
Or, how painful was this?
We are liberating U.N. data, some few U.N. organization.
He has to bury the people, OK?
But guess what happened?
So Kleiber is about process.
We've encountered joggers, busy highways, toll booths, and this is without a person in the loop; the car just drives itself.
Well, it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have.
But of course it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy.
(Yes.)
They say, "I have to give one up?"
You call them stock, or stock options, derivatives, mortgage-backed securities.
By the way, the Netherlands is an interesting story.
We understand our limitations, and we build around them.
Health is there and better health is up there.
I came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in.
We need to think in more nuanced ways about women's health.
It's our fears and our lack of knowledge and imagination that stands in the way of real reform.
It costs way less than obesity now.
I got a security clearance.
So, let me just show you.
Potatoes.
And it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.
But the students are not there.
I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow, and I got happy, of course: a 1.8 right answer out of five possible.
You've probably heard all this before.
And really, when you have no external input, that is a time when there is a creation of self, when you can do long-term planning, when you can try and figure out who you really are.
The first is the policy challenge of designing and implementing alternatives to ineffective prohibitionist policies, even as we need to get better at regulating and living with the drugs that are now legal.
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.
England is right behind you, as usual.
He told me that everything — the fevers, the sore throats, the sinus infection, all of the gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiac symptoms — were being caused by some distant emotional trauma that I could not remember.
So, my wish.
Our desire to alter our consciousness may be as fundamental as our desires for food, companionship and sex.
Progress is slow, and it is up and it is down, but I am getting a little better each day.
And I think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life.
In fact, relative to the option in the middle, which was get only the print for 125, the print and web for 125 looked like a fantastic deal.
Which I think is just fascinating.
Noise becomes music.
We've got a real problem with math education right now.
And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.
So I did just that.
What are your plans?
Beautiful town.
Let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks.
Am I sure that every single person followed that, understood it, was moved by it?
Then one day I had a fever of 104.7 degrees.
Interestingly, there are data on these two groups of people, data on how happy they are.
He grabbed his pen, he snatched his scissors.
Can't even get them there.
And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere.
I think that if we understood our cognitive limitations in the same way we understand our physical limitations, even though they don't stare us in the face the same way, we could design a better world, and that, I think, is the hope of this thing.
So to explain that, let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education.
Zoom into it and see where it was taken.
Are you staying at MIT, or are you going to do something with this?
You can pinch into any page.
You have the story of the audience as a community.
What we are interested in is information.
I think it's going to be older people.
But actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group.
And finally goes to E, and it's home.
But instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is.
So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?
School was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative, do wonderful things, make us earn a living, etc., etc.
And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess.
(Music) The whole orchestra is playing.
Immediately you get a really clear sense of "Do the kids know anything about where food comes from?"
But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.
Here we go.
If only we could move it to four percent, our problems would be over.
We actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things; what about that?
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.
We experimented on ourselves.
But the conductor doesn't make a sound.
What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one?
We call this the Global Village Construction Set.
That's all it takes, six-and-a-half grand per school.
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold.
We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase.
And I'm going to show you why.
I saw every kind of specialist: infectious disease doctors, dermatologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists.
This issue is much bigger than just my disease.
You ready?
What do we mean when we say we're doing math, or educating people to do math?
One I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore, and that they aren't slowing down and stopping, being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces, paleontology and panic architecture.
We have many intuitions in our life, and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.
What did he say about his experience?
You can start painting on any wall.
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year.
But for some reason, when it comes to the mental world, when we design things like healthcare and retirement and stock markets, we somehow forget the idea that we are limited.
It's a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make — that it's equal everything.
And we started to write software which could link the data like this.
Why is this?
It also runs on the iPhone.
Is there really nothing good or bad?
These are the quintiles of Uganda.
Turns out they're identical.
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.
Nobody is tone-deaf.
So, we try to test this.
What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head?
Some people, especially in Latin America, think it's not really about drugs.
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.
I found that I would have to build them myself.
So just because paper was invented before computers, it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics.
It's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall.
Whatever you're doing with your hands, it's understanding that gesture.
We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography.
But here's the good news.
How are you going to split your time going forward?
But the second challenge is tougher, because it's about us.
This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do, and that no other animal can do quite like we can.
We want people who can feel the math instinctively.
The error margin is narrow.
We can engage so many more students with this, and they can have a better time doing it.
And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent the world's annual income.
How much do you care about people?
It's nice poetry, but that can't exactly be right.
(Laughter) So, does it work?
You know, a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing, when I was working with a young pianist.
Think about this result.
And how did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970?
But freedom to choose, to change and make up your mind, is the enemy of synthetic happiness.
I started a group called Open Source Ecology.
(Laughter) He's a nice guy.
He keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him.
Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.
Um, he was happy.
And these were the developing countries: they had large families and they had relatively short lives.
You know, there's your week.
So I had to consider the possibility that he was right.
So, we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world.
And the reason is that tool use, in the beginning — for thousands and thousands of years, everything has been a physical modification of self.
Did anybody think while I was playing, "Why is he using so many impulses?"
Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket, you can just do the gesture of taking a photo, and it takes a photo for you.
Because the data is hidden down in the databases.
So, these guys are going to be part of the solution.
Yes you are.
It's not because it's trivial.
It can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that.
See what you can pick up from this.
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this.
Minerally?
Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?
That is not happening anymore.
Oh, the TED choir.
I know, easier said than done.
This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.
Probably.
(Singing) You know what happens?
This of course has two very clear implications for life in general.
And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there.
But you need to have process and content to create the meaning.
Calculating was typically the limiting step, and now often it isn't.
Knock out one source and another inevitably emerges.
The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.
And these were the results of the Swedish students.
In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here.
When he does this, it's not, "Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix, smash it on the floor."
And then, like all good academic projects, I got more funding.
United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well used.
This is preventable disease.
Because the meaning of the music is pain.
And because of that, you start to dig around for your external memories — where did you leave them?
So I have this distinction between what we're making people do and the subject that's sort of mainstream and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that.
And look at what we find.
So, Pranav, first of all, you're a genius.
I was burned very badly.
"Well, that's long life and small family, and Third World is short life and large family."
He's conducting Mozart.
Responsible in front of him.
And if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.
Even though these diseases disproportionately affect women, they are not women's diseases.
I can go here and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries.
This country over here is China.
Onion.
So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world, where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past.
Our subjects doubled their cheating.
The real music is only in Karajan's head.
That's what he does.
Maybe this is what it's like to be on the other side of 25.
(Laughter) And that just might be a net public health benefit.
People in my orchestra said, "Ben, what happened?"
See, crucial point here: math is not equal to calculating.
We don't know why ME sometimes runs in families, why you can get it after almost any infection, from enteroviruses to Epstein-Barr virus to Q fever, or why it affects women at two to three times the rate of men.
OK?
Why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject?
We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity.
(Applause)
I came together with patients around the world, and we started to fight.
It's a major subject.
But you know what?
And in our society, we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind.
Online we came together, and we shared our stories.
It doesn't matter what you once were; you can't do it anymore.
If you ever go bar-hopping, who do you want to take with you?
And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations.
So the next thing is take that problem and turn it from a real world problem into a math problem.
Everybody.
Here are two examples of this principle.
You're married to a guy and he picks his nose?
Many people say data is bad.
But if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people — I mean, not terrible in this — but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with, from another university, another group, all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up — a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment — and people cheat even less.
And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China, and brought them into the mainstream again.
Later, we moved to a much better, consumer-oriented pendant version of that, that many of you now know as the SixthSense device.
So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet very firm control.
Amazing number of people think they're tone-deaf.
Then they shredded it.
(Laughter)
When it comes to building the physical world, we kind of understand our limitations.
What does this cause us?
I had a sick body; that was all.
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients.
That is another story.
And what we really need to do is to bring the underground drug markets as much as possible aboveground and regulate them as intelligently as we can to minimize both the harms of drugs and the harms of prohibitionist policies.
Turns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV.
If this idea is truly sound, then the implications are significant.
But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure, consistent novelty.
I know how they do it.
We have an awful, awful reality right now.
So please, wait for the conductor.
And I said, "Great."
This is all U.N. statistics that have been available.
In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams, it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters.
And for me, it's quite romantic, but it's about if one person teaches three people how to cook something, and they teach three of their mates, that only has to repeat itself 25 times, and that's the whole population of America.
Something must be wrong there, yeah?
Week in, week out.
They still remain here.
And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.
From what I've seen, this is only the beginning.
The linearity is very strong between child survival and money.
If you do it without me I feel even more redundant than I already feel.
There's no statutory right to teach kids about food, elementary or secondary school, OK?
Now, I had an amazing experience.
Let's go.
Can anybody see them as identical?
Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $5,000?
Are we Superman, or are we Homer Simpson?
In the US, scientists at Stanford are finding abnormalities in energy metabolism that are 16 standard deviations away from normal.
This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.
Put your hands up.
And really, it ends up being more human than technology, because we're co-creating each other all the time.
And this is exactly what you expected, isn't it?
(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"
All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly-funded statistics.
The first experiment — I walked around MIT and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators — these were common refrigerators for the undergrads.
And I say, it's appropriate for us to ask the question, who are we being as we go back out into the world?
The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on regional level.
And I said, "Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?"
What do you say to them?
So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology.
He's a really nice guy.
Now, he tries E again, and that doesn't work.
This is from a paper by Redelmeier and Shafir.
It's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual.
And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one: "Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?"
And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way.
— have killed themselves.
He is a 67-year-old farmer.
These are different countries in Europe.
And with the right kind of help, maybe one day I could get better.
School food is something that most kids — 31 million a day, actually — have twice a day, more than often, breakfast and lunch, 180 days of the year.
And I believe truly, actually, that if change can be made in this country, beautiful things will happen around the world.
You know, it's now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff.
No, the music pushed me over, which is why I call it one-buttock playing.
And the unimaginable happened: it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge, winning Stanford 2 million dollars.
And you know what happened to Muti?
I want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality.
How could my doctor have gotten it so wrong?
Two one-hour sessions.
And then finally, turn it back to the real world.
(Claps) (Laughter)
This is the change in liking score, the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked.
It's in the players' heads.
And when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them, so, how painful was this?
66 percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture.
He's awesome.
And then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side, and exchanged it for dollars.
Most of you.
The key symptom we all share is that whenever we exert ourselves — physically, mentally — we pay and we pay hard.
We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us.
Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form.
People don't check, and they don't join.
All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families.
People tend to think of prohibition as the ultimate form of regulation when in fact it represents the abdication of regulation with criminals filling the void.
What is it we're trying to find out here?
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.
Because Muti... (Laughter) Okay?
So the challenges we face today are twofold.
Open it up.
No, otherwise the play would be over, stupid.
In fact, I'll come to your dorm room, just give me an email.
Another solo now.
And then he died.
