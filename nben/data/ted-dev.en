And it's sort of evolved.
So what do we need in order to make developing nation megacities into Bright Green megacities?
You can do it any time, therefore you can do it more and better.
It can change our world in immensely important ways, because if you're grateful, you're not fearful, and if you're not fearful, you're not violent.
And as a consequence, people chose it.
Consider our neighbor, Mars.
(Applause) To do that, don't look at the agribusiness model for the future.

And what's in your filter bubble depends on who you are, and it depends on what you do.
And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light in the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it — that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.
And you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data.
They don't want to spend such a large part of their life doing this hard work with so relatively low productivity.

And when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print indulgences, which was the equivalent of printing money.
Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of forces are, in fact, accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance.
So first we'll do things that don't require a lot of robotics.
The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen.
Hold it up.
Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible.
So how do we develop the skills that we need?
How can each one of us find a method for living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful, but moment by moment to be grateful.

(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much.
I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools, where did it come from?

And I wanted, through color and large format cameras and very large prints, to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape, how we use the land.
And that is, there is an abnormal gene, a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring.
But then you lose control of it.
But once you also have people living in close proximity to each other, one of the things you can do is — as information technologies develop — you can start to have smart places.
The Earth spins, of course, as it travels around the sun, so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle, like some Earthlings.

I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my "Creative Projects" folder — it's a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.
The tempos are medium.
For teenagers, it's at the lunchroom table.
And you know, an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
I'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs: actually losing it, never to be seen again.
So now, instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke, you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products, in your office, or back at work in your home.
Well, I just told you there's data coming out of your ears.
So in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding.
Then we know what to do.
And I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person.
And he's teaching her how to browse.
You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem.
This is an 8,000-square-foot installation composed of many different creatures, some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor.
Not likely.
So what we did was put all the instructions online as open source.
It's not about being scarce, it's about accessibility.
First is physiological.
So I was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.
Then we match them in pairs by computer.
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of — The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.
If we had, our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space.
And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting "chicken," you're sitting there, looking at the person, waiting for them to look away, and then quickly checking the device.
But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.
That's not our job.
I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls.
Now I think this is a solvable problem.
That means that instead of seeing the sunlight that asteroids reflect, NEOWISE sees the heat that they emit.
Now in life, and in meditation, there'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense, and life starts to feel a bit like this.
When does this breakdown begin?
So we all know this, when we're really stressed out, we're not acting our best.
You learn the number list and you learn how to apply it.
Now, keyboards evolved from organs to clavichords to harpsichords to the piano, until the middle of the 19th century, when a bunch of inventors finally hit on the idea of using a keyboard to trigger not sounds but letters.
Week in, week out.
They shared a destiny with their enemies.
It conquered quick
Don't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone, that an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away, that there's no way for it to metastasize; it does.
Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space.
And these little holes that you can see, this is where all the apple cells used to be.
It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour.
And I think some people may have misunderstood.
It attracts a lot of biodiversity.
I've found the best people to work with are physicists, engineers and mathematicians, who tend to think algorithmically.
And so I was surprised when I noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed.
And so we evolved into social animals, where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe, where we felt like we belonged.
How could you have a problem like this?
This leads to this question.
Kind of exciting.
The project I'm going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game, and essentially it is also an empty space.
But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship.
So I said, oh my gosh.
11th Man: Who am I?
And dark matter is no exception.
This is our group, our main group of weavers.
So, the Holy Grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column — and it's not just for neuroscience; it's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality, and perhaps to even also understand physical reality.
And as we like to say — and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here — if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.
In 25 years it's gone from this, to this.
(Applause) (Applause)
But I want to tell them that all of this is just debris left over when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be, and if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself, get a better mirror, look a little closer, stare a little longer, because there's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit.
That's, to put it mildly, not what's on the table now.
My big break came in 2010.
Now this encrypted data is sent through the server to Alice, and because the message was encrypted using Alice's public key, the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to Alice, and it turns out Alice is the only person that actually has this key.
So I just published a book about introversion, and it took me about seven years to write.
I play the part of a magician, a wizard, if you will, a real wizard.
(Applause) However there is a political battle in our country.
So we decided to paste white, white on the walls.
(Video) Glenn Gray: Many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives.
And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up.
But there's another rare syndrome, so rare, in fact, that very few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists.
It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger.
The size of the bubble here is the population.
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime, that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives.
What I'm going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines that create the living fabric of your body.
When you go in these developing societies, women are the pillars of their community, but the men are still the ones holding the streets.
And they are also part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now.
He pointed out that certain people in the population, who are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity: every time they see a number, it's colored.
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.
In comics, I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works.
And I think you matter.
So he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip mounted inside on the collar of the cat, and opens the door and the cat can eat the food.
And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle, and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water.
And that's Richard Feynman.
I hope this worries you, by the way —
It's dormant.
Actually they just build them themselves for a lot less using Arduino and a few parts.
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.
It's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me.
My father always said, "No one gives a shit."
Because human beings are, to some extent, hivish creatures like bees.
"Wopp!"
The bell curve shows 150 controls, and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe.
Don't just bombard them with stuff.
And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide.
They're endangered because we're moving towards social networking.
But the process itself is without purpose, without foresight, without design.
Remember him — old philosopher?
And once that happened, once this material was in Latin, it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years.
I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe.
Pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing.
There was massive flooding in Indonesia.
It's a very simple method.
We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift.
My life was touched because when I was 11 years old, Thanksgiving, no money, no food, we were not going to starve, but my father was totally messed up, my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up, and somebody came to the door and delivered food.
And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training.
Yes you are.
Let's play a game.

And a lot of what goes on inside — There's a fish with glowing eyes, pulsating eyes.
The marketing is, the bigger a brand, the more difficult it is to reposition it.
And Congress did something.
And so he suggested a machine, and he called it the memex.
What they do, we now understand, is they get in you, they wait, they start growing, they count themselves with these little molecules, and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together, they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host.
Is it totalitarian to require reading, writing and arithmetic?
One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East is that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians, do not understand that they share a collective destiny.
Now we're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes and look at its structure and describe it.
Forty percent of Kenya's GDP moves through M-Pesa using phones like this.
Now that's a great deal of us, isn't it?
So in California, everybody's really excited about a little square of plastic that you plug into a phone and you can swipe your credit card, and people say, "We've liberated the credit card from the point of sale terminal."
Find it.
So I decided to do the experiment that I would have loved The Economist to do with me.
Couldn't have done it 20 years ago when the idea of having any language you wanted in your pocket, coming from your phone, would have sounded like science fiction to very sophisticated people.
It's needs we have.
Here, the -0.5 is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion.
You feel good when you do something right, you feel bad when you do something wrong.
And that can also come from some kind of confusions.
In extreme cases, electroconvulsive therapy, which is like a controlled seizure in the patient's brain, is also very helpful.
And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants.
Now, it's not some creepy thing.
The tradition is that in the winter, in that city, you wear your socks on the outside of your boots.
So let's do that.
They fly in and they pollinate.
Standardized tests have a place.
So here's how things play out.
That's not the expression of joy.
I could have told you 50 others just like it — all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go, that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert.
And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller.
If we are making a fruit forest, we increase the percentage of fruit-bearing trees.
(Laughter) I have to do my carbon offset in another way, like I do every time.
(Laughter) But as I — in terms of educational assets.
And he said to the guy, "Why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see?"
Nature, on the other hand, works in a totally opposite way.
The system is so healthy, it's totally self-renewing.
This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.
No one's ever said that before.
We own our minds.
So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal.
And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be, that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.
There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper.
Nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London who died of consumption.
There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is "nkali."
Last year, we issued an even more difficult challenge.
And they gathered together because the technologists wanted to learn what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective.
I bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.
It's a primitive form of abstraction, and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain, because when that's damaged, these people lose the ability to engage in Buba Kiki, but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor.
Here's what's true: we need it.
The children came running in.
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important — there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.
It could be concurrency.
And I feel that here.
I love Big Placebo.
I know what I have just said is simply not obvious.
That is what we have done on this planet.
The culture of giving and doing good has become contagious.
Using the oxytocin inhaler, we ran more studies.
And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first.
And the great thing about it is that we've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about "disappear."
So you can open this one.
Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world.
Now, if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics, then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country.

So imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes, all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines, and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better.
So we keep going down this road, 20 years from now, the word 'privacy' is going to have a completely different meaning from what it means to you and I.
Guess what?
Film, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge.
So let's begin.
"Don't worry, you're doing great."
Guilty people got guilty, sad people got sad.
We start to devalue the things we can do every day, We take moments where we truly are a leader and we don't let ourselves take credit for it, or feel good about it.
Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser, and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make.
Tough thing to do.
It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa.

They sell off the assets.
All this is possible with your mobile phone.
How?
He said, "I think he thinks better of me now."
But if you consider the green part of the brain stem, nothing like that happens.
So, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent.

This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image.
So, in summary, I think that the universe may have — it's possible — evolved a brain to see itself, which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself.
That's an order of magnitude, up or down.
It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.
So, I wrote a book on my research.
Maybe, but it's not going to be young people, because it's not going to be legalized for them, and quite frankly, they already have the best access to marijuana.
And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.

And if you pull the cords under the knot, you will see that the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe.
Narrator: America is in crisis — the economy, national security, the climate crisis.
It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my 1991 book, "Consciousness Explained," where I said if you did experiments of this sort, you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.
Most of these discussions are still happening online.
And I took my bike into the bike store— I love this — same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.
What are bits made of, Mom?
And it's perfectly legal.
And once you've sparked that desire, it will be so much easier to start building your idea.
Half of the world's forests have vanished.
Strange.
And many of our ideas have been formed, not to meet the circumstances of this century, but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries.

The white group there is the control group; they change nothing.
I chose the royal colors of purple and black, because I want them to be reminded that they are descendants of greatness, and that through education, they are future engineers, scientists, entrepreneurs and even leaders who can and will take over this world.
It's a human system.
And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.
So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas, really coming into the room, they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts, like they really want to occupy space.

And at TED here in February, their passion and brilliance just took our breath away.
We weren't the only kids who grew up this way.
Inequalities in China and India I consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market, what will avoid social instability, and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population.
This says that entropy, which is a measure of the disorder of a system, will always increase.
Steven Weinberg, the Nobel laureate, once said, "The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it seems pointless."

Of course there's health consequences to this, scary ones, besides the waist.
Now, what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain, so everything is cross-connected?
But there was a problem.
Over the last four years, business has grown double digits, whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased.
The granny cloud sits over there.
It's stuck in the present right now, but we have an amazing opportunity.
I said we can be grateful in every given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted with something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity that is given to us.
It will stop because of the growing demand of us on all the resources, all the capacity, all the systems of the Earth, which is now having economic damage.

I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that.
The first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society, and I think that it is a key step in evolution.
Much of this work is funded by NASA.
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.
And then —
Simple, beautiful furniture?
Feasting?
The Charleston was all about improvisation and musicality, making its way into Lindy Hop, swing dancing and even the Kid n Play, originally called the Funky Charleston.
But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running.

And quite spontaneously, nobody expected, people started trading with each other.
The most important bit about your structure — whether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment, whether you're a business — is your docking points, your interconnectors, your capacity to network with others.
It's a remarkable thing.
Let's see, I'd say about three or four percent.
This is the machine below Geneva.
We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms.
Well I think something like that is the situation we're in with consciousness.
You all, I guess, like me, enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance.
It was honesty and transparency that brought us together.
There might be some way of treating that as true.
Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way.
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book, because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.
Why do I feel like a fake?
(Laughter) But in fact that's not why they went extinct.

The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny, the Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to "Plan 9" to nine lives: it's all the same.
My big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university, we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat.
Very Zen-like.
We reconditioned them all, fixed them.

Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories — experimental predictions — to specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy.
I have to go slightly obscure, but really you should seek it out.
So next, the scientific method — an axiom of physics, of all science — says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation, you can only disprove it.
(Laughter) And this happens constantly in the writing.

It's able to feel when the cell is ready, when the chromosome is correctly positioned.
So even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain, by the time the structure has been folded, its physical location is very different between individuals, even identical twins.
And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain, our center for control and experience.
It doesn't come from salary.
I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.
My lab started working on this, and I want to show you the result.

The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to.
It's otherworldly, beautiful.
(Clapping to the beat)
I didn't want to go; I love my life.
Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process.
A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi, has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory.

And every single day since then, 1,100 Americans have died.
It's really difficult to disentangle those strands.

And I thought: Well, if this is a model for creation, if we make music, primarily the form at least, to fit these contexts, and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls, and if we write software to fit existing operating systems, is that how it works?
Stuck in traffic.
It really is this young versus the old to some degree.
I never heard anyone say this about Anderson Cooper and his crew, who were attacked covering the same story.

The halls got bigger.
So the people kept it.
We're going to discuss what we can do to make these added years really successful and use them to make a difference.
And I think, if you take all of these filters together, you take all these algorithms, you get what I call a filter bubble.
