You breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways, to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.
Now, it could be that motion pictures — and eventually, virtual reality, or something equivalent to it — some sort of immersive display, is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we're in.

(Laughter) "And I'm not even talking about you behind me, because I've got eyes in the back of my head."
Information, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment smells like and tastes like, what it feels like and what it sounds like.

Powerful new technologies always present enigmas.
In this book, Smith argued that we are moral creatures, not because of a top-down reason, but for a bottom-up reason.
Now, as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth, the more you appreciate our own planet itself.
The real role of leadership is climate control, creating a climate of possibility.
You were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.
I've got one more problem, then I'm through.
The data came back from the United States, from England, from Sweden, from Canada, and it was all the same: no correlation, no connection, none at all.

Homeopathy, let's find out what that's all about.
And the first rule of the game is pretty simple.
So we're going to have a little experiment.
It can spread over acres and acres of area, or it could fit in a small space — as small as your house garden.
And in humans, we call it the "body clock."
I've done it for 30 years.
How clever would we have to be?
The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral.
It's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer.
I went on to cover many, many, many wars after that, so many that I lost count, but there was nothing like Sarajevo.

And as adults, we're certainly not alone.
But until recently, we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe.
And I really wanted it to be an open project, because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the United States right now, and could possibly become another area like Monsanto, where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people's food.
But it was a very clever move.
So I said, "Yeah, that's possible."
And so it should be.
Most importantly... Most importantly...
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place, because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head.
There is a glass bridge that you walk across that's suspended in space.
I hope that together, we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
It is the magic of science.
How many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow, and you went to the DMV, and you encountered one of these forms, that it would actually change your own behavior?
Or is it more likely that a reader of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?
No doubt that it's going to happen, in my mind.
We maintain that, put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales.
And I think there are many possible explanations for it.
Just looking at these is fascinating.
So what do I do?
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar.
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising.

So, what is it for?
So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.
Not yours, of course — other people's.
Two invisible forces.
You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between the brain stem and the body.
That's our job.
Now, while... (Applause) While you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
The first two are shared with many, many other species, and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species.
Well, on the panpsychist view, you can leave the equations of physics as they are, but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness.
We then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad.
Accountants and lawyers are still needed.
Well, pretty well anyway.
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances.
I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life.

We lose diversity.
Well, people used to believe there was a life force to be living, and we now know that's really not true at all.
They laughed together.
I also believe that in thinking about things — my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents, God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces — I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.
And I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook.

I don't need to go into that.
There's no conversation.
It's got some math that I can do.

The only reason these people buy touch-tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.
Now, the cylinders were too expensive and time-consuming to make, but a half century later, another French inventor named Jacquard hit upon the brilliant idea of using paper-punched cards instead of metal cylinders.
So the idea that we can smoothly transition to a highly-efficient, solar-powered, knowledge-based economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in 2050 a life of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion.
And this will just continue, and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change.

He said we're social creatures, so we share the emotions of others.
But there's a problem with this, and that is, the email servers also hold the encryption keys, so now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it.
We are huge packages of chemicals.
I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently, in front of a church: "Good without God becomes zero."
So I'm clean, but I do behave like you saw like a 21-year-old in my movies.

(Laughter) I don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us, but... but, to be honest, the description goes on and it says that it "doesn't rank high in quality, however."
You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all.
I want to do so because, in my view, the most important issue we face is how we respond to this question.
So for do-it-yourselfers, we provide free, very well-tested instructions so that anyone, anywhere around the world, can build one of these systems for free.
Now, I just do not believe that.
I picked two well-known examples, because they're very well-known for expressing science through art.

And there's a cause for that, all right.
Cynthia and I were there.
Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere, where we are.
And it's technological, so it can do things like microelectronics, and maybe photonics do.
But then, to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the Earth, we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules.
So at those deep oceanic vents, fantastic chemistry began to happen, and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations.
We can turn data into a time-lapse view of a global economy in motion.
Some people say, I only believed in remembering the past, imagining the future, never the present.
But enormously different motivations here.
It's outdated.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
Childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10.
I studied one single virtue: trustworthiness.
And it's been terribly successful.
No, there's something else, something really fundamental, and it is: another reason why we don't have a good brain theory is because we have an intuitive, strongly held but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer.
But Dad got really scared: he didn't want us doing that.
If you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life-permitting survival range, you go into disease or death.

They were extremely well-funded.
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."
They don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads.
Just flash it, scare the guy.
We determine how this will all end.
So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment.
A few years ago, my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry.
Some of my favorite things, like chocolate and tea, blueberries, alcohol in moderation, stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana.
And this forest keeps growing exponentially.
I'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.
Can we cut down a little bit further, because, as a designer, I need the vocabulary, I need the keyboard, of how this actually works.
Now notice, in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world, you have fixed alliances — NATO, the Warsaw Pact.

We have really severe energy problems in Africa.
And on top of that, it's at the point where instant translation of live speech is not only possible, but it gets better every year.
And I realize that you're probably thinking to yourselves, this is all fine, but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy and I can't imagine it would work there.
So democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political choices available in those societies.
It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC, colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately, and showering particles into the detector.
And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them.
And the gun went off, and all I remember was finishing last and fighting back tears of frustration and incredible — incredible — this feeling of just being overwhelmed.
So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it.
And I would say, "But that's crazy."
And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back.
A child a week was dying, but nothing changed.
We use something broadly called model-based design.
What it is is a map of innovation.
And they thought that they clarified the issue, because they'd set out a clear distinction between legal and illegal copying.
What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.
And these two males are fighting.
To my surprise, eliminating net CO2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap, not very cheap, but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization.
But that's very simplistic, so let's go down and look at Tanzania.
So, I was trying to basically make measurements.
They have very few genes, and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out.

Did you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash?
But, both of these sayings — saving a fish from drowning, or saving a man from drowning — to me they had to do with intentions.
But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye, I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature.
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it — some are a bit high for that, I agree — but the people in the street, they are the curator.

That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna.
This little relief on the footplate, by the way, to a rider means there's something going on underneath it — in this case, a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably, taking the power from the engine.

But I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written, or was writing at the time, didn't sound all that great in some of those halls.
So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material.
Now I know you don't think that.
I hope when you learn things, like about how the natural world works — I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child.
They're in the crowd, and the crowd is switching on lights, and we can see them for the first time, not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers, but as individuals we can learn from.
This is by Drew Weing; this is called, "Pup Contemplates the Heat Death of the Universe."
All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.
And "Eureka!"
That would mean that I was a chancer and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it.
It has zones of production, like Afghanistan and Columbia.
Wouldn't that be so cool, and that wouldn't that open up all sorts of new possibilities?
And you can think of different formats.
They really did a fantastic job.
I call this environmental arbitrage.
Human groups may look like hives for brief moments, but they tend to then break apart.
So what will you do?
So far, so good.
I didn't get the part.
But he was, in fact, a moral philosopher, and he was right on why we're moral.
And as the day goes by the bacteria double, they release the molecule, and then light comes on at night, exactly when the squid wants it.
We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert.
It's very hard to change people's minds about something like consciousness, and I finally figured out the reason for that.
It was the Congolese women who are now rising up.
PIPA is short for PROTECTIP, which is itself short for Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property — because the congressional aides who name these things have a lot of time on their hands.

So, what kind of stories might make a difference for the future?
And people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for.
And a focus group cannot do it.
Actually, I argue that there is another revolution going on, and it's the one that has to do with open-source hardware and the maker's movement, because the printer that my friend used to print the toy is actually open-source.
I can beam them to whichever school I want to.
And in short, with this system, we win.
One answer lies deep in our cultural history.
