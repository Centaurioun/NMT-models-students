So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle, because the observation changes it.
I went outside what I thought I knew.
How are you going to feed the world?
You see, if the conditions are wrong, we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other, and that inherently weakens the organization.
So the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this, and so the way that we're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools, and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways.

We built the hardware and the software.
So we're talking about things like infill development: really sharp little changes to where we have buildings, where we're developing.
And two years ago, even, this project would not have happened, just because the technology then wouldn't have supported it.
Well, it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick.
It's victimless.
She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married, after she had kids, and even after she got divorced and was a single parent, she continued her medical work.

And then from about 500 years ago, humans began to link up globally through shipping, through trains, through telegraph, through the Internet, until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals.
What's the result of that?
But again, I am not a sculptor,
Now I hope you enjoy the session.
So that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value, the value's in the uncopiable things, the immediacy, the authentication, the personalization.

Third, a trajectory is planned that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball.
The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior, how a traffic jam behaves, how a hurricane functions, how a living organism reproduces and adapts and metabolizes, all questions about objective functioning.
But you can compare it to a state in America.
That's just not convenient for propaganda.
This is an 8,000-square-foot installation composed of many different creatures, some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor.

And he's driving it all with this platform here, with a five-finger keyboard and the world's first computer mouse, which he specially designed in order to do this system.
So along with colleagues in Zurich, we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo, had that same trust test with money, and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust, we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger — all without altering mood or cognition.
(Video) Who knows what this is?
I got a security clearance.
Or even if you're flat, you might shift money into it.

And I want to share with you a quick video from our facility that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale.
The world's ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide, and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine.
And our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently.
So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.
But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this.
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet.

This is the proportion of the population in prison.
We don't need God or government telling us what to do.
So they call us out and, you know — "Ladies, you have one minute."

The truth is that's not always the case.
We want to give our child opportunities, education, discipline them when necessary, all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves.
And energy does something else quite magical: it congeals to form matter — quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons.

So about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around, trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other, and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends, in the mining world actually, and in the plastics world, and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.
It might sound like it's a bad thing.
And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process.
So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.
You know, when I was learning about programming, I learned by looking at other people's code, or looking at other people's circuits in magazines.
So does that.

And I'll quote three people: Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee.
Not right now.
Just people sending their pictures.
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff, particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner.
What it is is a map of innovation.
I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted.
But the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells — the fact that these cells are derived from five-day old human embryos — has encouraged research into other types of stem cells.
So I decided to try and write something more fun.
Come on, you're thinking.
And I wanted more.
